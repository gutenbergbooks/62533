<h2>Foreword</h2>


<p class="drop-capy1">If the reader will cast a thought back to the
classic sea mystery of the <i>Marie Celeste</i>, it will
be clear how much this book owes its inception to
the extraordinary derelict, the mystery of which
remains unsolved to this day. But the author disclaims
any attempt in the following pages to offer a
solution of the mystery and has only used certain
of the features surrounding the condition of the
<i>Marie Celeste</i> at the time she was found abandoned
in mid-ocean for the purposes of his story-narrative.</p>

<span class="fs95">The Adventurers</span></h2>


<p class="drop-capy1">IT was a time of tense emotion. Each was a-surge
with an almost uncontrollable excitement as the two
men moved up the whole length of the riffled sluice.
Neither uttered one single word. But they moved
slowly on either side of the long, primitive, box-like
construction, keeping pace, each with the other, as
though in a mutual desire that such fortune as was
theirs should be witnessed together, as though neither
had courage to face alone the possibilities of this their
first serious “washing.”</p>

<p>At each riffle the men paused. The more emotional
of the two, Len Stern, thrust out a hand and stirred
the deposit lying there. And at each stirring the same
result was revealed. The riffles were filled with deposit.
On the top was a spread of lighter soil, with
here and there a dull yellow protrusion thrusting above
it. But under this lay a solid thickness of pure alluvial
gold in dust and smaller nuggets. From the top
end of the sluice-box to the mouth which disgorged
the red soil upon the miniature mountain of tailings<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
below it, it was the same. There was not one single
riffle that was not laden to its capacity with the precious
metal.</p>

<p>They came to a halt at the head of the box. Len
Stern stood for a moment gazing down its narrow
channel. But Jim Carver was disinclined for any
dreaming. Stolid, practical, for all the emotion of
those amazing moments, he climbed up the light trestle
work and shut off the water stream which had
supplied the washing. Then he dropped again to the
ground and waited.</p>

<p>The stream of water fell away, and instantly the
torrid heat of the sun began to dry up the woodwork.
And as his gaze passed down over the succession of
riffles the unshining yellow of their precious burden
suggested a golden pathway the whole length of the
sluice.</p>

<p>“It makes you feel good, Len,” he said quietly, for
all the burning excitement in his big blue eyes.</p>

<p>The other nodded as though the thing he were contemplating
had left him speechless.</p>

<p>Jim Carver eyed him shrewdly. Then he glanced
up at the blazing tropical sky. He gazed down at the
slow-moving river, meandering on between jungle-grown
banks on its way to the bay, less than five miles
distant. Finally he bestirred himself.</p>

<p>“We best clean this wash up, Len,” he said. “We
best clean it up an’ take it right back to camp. It’s
feed time.”</p>

<p>He started to work at the top riffle, and Len Stern
came back to realities.</p>

<p>“Sure,” he agreed. And at once joined in the work.
“Say, Jim, do you get it?” he cried, glancing quickly
at the mountain of pay dirt they had spent months<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
in accumulating, standing ready for washing. “We
guessed to wash a ton. Maybe it was, more or less.
Ther’s not ounces in these riffles&mdash;no, ther’s&mdash;ther’s
pounds!”</p>

<p>Jim nodded as he laboured.</p>

<p>“It’s the biggest ‘strike’ ever made in the world,” he
admitted in a tone that might well have been taken for
one of grudging.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It was the northwest coast of Australia, the coast of
that almost unexplored region which is one of the few
remote territories of the world still retaining its fabulous
atmosphere of romance.</p>

<p>It was on the shores of a wide, shallow bay where a
small river abruptly opened out its land arms in welcome
to the tropical ocean. Sun-scorched, fleshy vegetation
grew densely almost to the water’s edge, keeping
dank and fever-laden the suffocating atmosphere
within its widespread bosom. Yet only was it this
merciful shade that made life endurable to sensitive
human creatures.</p>

<p>The sun was at its zenith, a furious disc of molten
heat in a brazen sky. The sea at the river mouth lay
dead flat under its burning rays, except for the ripple
where some huge submarine creature disturbed its
surface. Not a breath of air was stirring to relieve
the suffocating atmosphere.</p>

<p>The two men were lounging in the shade of the
wattle walls of their reed-thatched shelter. It was
built amidst a cluster of dense-growing trees, and the
site looked out over the brilliant bay. They had long
since eaten, and were now awaiting the cooling of the
day before returning to their labours.</p>

<p>They were youthful adventurers, foreigners to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
country in which they found themselves. They were
northerners, far-northerners, from the great snow-crowned
hills of Alaska. They had set out on their
adventure as a result of listening to the flimsiest, most
fanciful yarn that ever a half-vagrant Chinaman had
dispensed out of the remote cells of his drug-laden
imagination. And as a result, that day, after two-and-a-half
years of marooning on a coast peopled only
by none too friendly blacks, and in the heart of a
jungle alive with every bug and beast and reptile of
a pestilential nature, they had, at long last, proved
beyond every question of doubt that Charlie Wun Lee
had, for once in his life, fallen a victim to sheer
veracity.</p>

<p>For all its usually incredible source, the story, which
had set these men wandering in the world’s remote
places, had had a curious ring of reality in it. Charlie
Wun Lee was a queer, reasonably honest, far-travelled
old Chinaman who dispensed ham and eggs to belated
travellers in a squalid frame house in their home town
of Beacon Glory, hidden away in the hill country of
Alaska. And his story had been inspired by sheer
friendliness for two men who found themselves in a
position where the outlook for livelihood was completely
threatening.</p>

<p>He had told them he knew where there was more
gold than the world had ever seen before, and both
being gold men their appetites had been at once
whetted.</p>

<p>Briefly, his story was that he had been shipwrecked
when he was cook on an Australian coasting vessel.
The ship went to pieces, but he and six others reached
land after terrible privations. All they knew about
their whereabouts was that it was the coast of Australia<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
somewhere on the northwest of the continent.
It was a country of unbearable heat and fever-haunted
jungle. They were marooned on this coast for more
than a year, keeping body and soul together with such
food as they could collect from the sea and the forest.
Fortunately, they had little need for clothing, for they
discovered not a living soul, and no indication, even, of
the blacks whom they knew peopled these regions of
the country. But during that long, desperate year one
by one his white companions had died off, victims of
a subtle jungle fever that killed them slowly and painfully,
until only he and one other were left alive. This
stealing death frightened him. The dank jungle became
a place of dread. So he and his last remaining
companion took to the river and sought to reach the
hills out of which it sprang.</p>

<p>But they never reached the hills. No. The river
claimed them. They forgot their fears. They forgot
even their contemplated destination. In his own
graphic fashion he told them the river was alive with
gold. Gold looked up at them out of the pay dirt
which composed its bed throughout its whole course.
Oh, yes. They tried it out with such means as they
had to their hands. But they only collected nuggets
of reasonable size and troubled nothing with “dust.”
They collected a large quantity and secreted them, and
it was this store that ultimately started him on the way
to the prosperity he now enjoyed.</p>

<p>After this he endeavoured to study the coast line
with a view to making a chart at such time as he might
be rescued, for he had never given up the hope that
they would ultimately be rescued. And sure enough
they were. A storm-driven coasting vessel ran into the
mouth of the river for shelter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span></p>

<p>They were taken on board and clothed. But they
kept their secret of the gold, determined, should opportunity
ever offer, to come again and work it. On
the plea of desiring to know the position of the territory
which had been so disastrous to them, the skipper
of the boat was induced to give them the exact bearings
of the river mouth, and later, Charlie Wun Lee
inscribed it on his rough chart which he produced in
corroboration of his story. He also produced for his
audience a couple of nuggets of gold which he declared
he had kept as a souvenir ever since.</p>

<p>But he shook his head sadly over them when he told
how opportunity never came of returning to collect the
gold awaiting him. His companion died on the way
to Sydney, a victim of the jungle fever, the germs of
which had contrived to impregnate him. And he&mdash;well,
other things came his way and he did not fancy
facing the hateful coast alone. Besides, he did very
well with the laundry he started in Sydney until he
got burnt out, and finally migrated to Alaska. No, he
assured them, he would rather dispense ham and eggs
at two dollars a time in Beacon Glory than go back
for that gold. Besides, his little gambling parlour at
the back of his restaurant was not so bad a gold
mine.</p>

<p>Well, anyhow, there it was. It was true what he had
told them. Every word of it. And if they liked they
could have the chart as a present. And when they
came back with all the gold they needed, if the jungle
fever didn’t get hold of them and they felt like making
him a present in return, well, he would very gladly
receive it. But, whether they chose to go after it or
not, he wanted them to know that the thing he had
told them was no fairy story, but the real truth, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
was a wholly inadequate illustration of the reality of
wealth he had seen there.</p>

<p>Now they knew the real extent of the debt they owed
to the friendly little dispenser of ham and eggs. But
they also knew now, after the fierce excitement of
witnessing the result of the first real washing had subsided,
the immensities of the proposition confronting
them. As yet neither had uttered a word of doubt or
anxiety. But the thought of the potentialities of the
situation was looming heavily.</p>

<p>Jim Carver’s blue eyes were turned upon the sunlit
bay. He was deeply engrossed, not in the wonders of
the tropical scene set out before him, but in a train of
teeming thought. His pipe was his only real comfort
on this intolerable coast, and he was enjoying it to the
uttermost at the moment. Len Stern’s dark eyes were
upon the small mountain of raw gold heaped on an
outspread flour sack on the sun-baked ground in front
of him, which represented the result of their first
“clean-up.” Whatever worries lay back of his mind
his mercurial temperament refused to be robbed of one
moment of the delight which this tangible result of
their labours afforded.</p>

<p>“Man, I feel I just want to holler!” he cried in a
sudden outburst, breaking up the silence which was so
much their habit. “Say, I just can’t get a grip on the
nature of a boy who sits around doping out ham an’
eggs with the knowledge of a thing like this back of
his mind. He’s all sorts of a sheer damn fool&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Is he?”</p>

<p>Jim had removed his pipe. He had turned his big,
thoughtful eyes on the man contemplating the heaped
treasure. Len was gazing at him, his smile of delight
completely passed from his dark face.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span></p>

<p>They were both big creatures. Broad, and enormously
muscular, a picture of virile capacity and latent
human energy. Jim’s eyes were frankly wide and blue
as the distant sea, set in a face whose skin lent itself to
a deep, florid sunburn. Len was dark-eyed and dark-skinned.
He was burned to the mahogany of a nigger.
Both were clad in barely sufficient clothing to
meet the demands of decency.</p>

<p>For a moment Len stared at his companion. Then
his smile slowly returned.</p>

<p>“Say, Jim, boy, ain’t ther’ a darn thing in all this
to set you crazy to shout?” He shook his head. “It’s
no sort of use. Your head’s always ready to shelter
every old bogey it can collect. Two an’ a bit years of
hell! That’s what it’s been. The folks guessed we
were bug. The yarn of a ham-slingin’ Chink. A river
of gold! An’ I guess we came nigh breakin’ our folks
for outfit. Well, it’s ours. All of it. An’ I guess we
can pay our folk a hundred times over. It’s a strike
to unship the world’s financial balance. Psha! It’s
so big&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“That’s the trouble, Len. It’s too big.”</p>

<p>Len flung his head back in a boisterous laugh.</p>

<p>“Too big?” he cried scornfully. “It just couldn’t
be!”</p>

<p>“It could. It is.”</p>

<p>Jim’s unyielding tone promptly brought the other to
seriousness.</p>

<p>“How?” he asked soberly. “Maybe I’ve got some
of your notion. But let’s talk it out.”</p>

<p>Jim knocked out his pipe and refilled it. He lit it
thoughtfully. Then he turned smilingly to his friend.</p>

<p>“Say, I’m as crazy for this thing as you, boy,” he
said in his quiet way. “But I don’t figger to let it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
snow my senses under. You’re right. It’s been two
years an’ more of hell gettin’ it, and we want it all, after
that. But I seem to see something of what was back
of Charlie’s mind quittin’ the game an’ never returning
to it. Get a look down there.” He pointed at a rough
sheltered landing with a tubby, cutter-rigged fishing
smack lying moored there. “That’s our link with the
world outside. An’ we got to get out not pounds, but
tons of metal if I’m a judge. We got to market it
an’ keep it quiet, or we’ll have the Australian Government
jumping in on us, to say nothing of all the rest
of the world.” He shook his head. “How’s it to be
done? It can’t.”</p>

<p>“But it can. It must!”</p>

<p>Len’s whole manner had undergone a complete transformation.
All the excited delight had passed out of
his eyes. They had suddenly become hard, and shrewd,
and full of keen resolution. The thought of failure
with the prize in their hands had stirred him to a feeling
like that of a mother who sees her offspring about
to be snatched from her arms. He was ready to fight
with the last breath of life for this thing he so dearly
coveted.</p>

<p>“Here, you can’t tell me a thing I haven’t thought,
Jim,” he cried. “All this stuff’s been in my brain tank
ever since we bought that barge of ours down in
Perth. I’d got it all then. An’ I planned it all before
we beat it up the coast in that old coaster, with our
craft on a tow-line. You’re right. It’s got to be a secret.
If we shout we’ll lose half the game. Maybe
we’ll lose it all. We’re not going to shout. No. I
best tell you, an’ we’ll sort out the metal from the tailings.
You’ve a cautious head and a clear brain.
Maybe you’ll see any weak spot lying around.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span></p>

<p>Jim nodded in ready agreement. He had achieved
his purpose. Len was down to hard facts.</p>

<p>“This is the thing I got planned,” Len went on,
dipping his hands into the pile of gold and letting it
sift back between his hard-worn fingers. “We’ve got
to get a third feller into our game&mdash;on commission.
We got to think wide and act wide. We got to play
a red-hot game, an’ play it good. Ther’s got to be no
weakening, an’ if any feller we work with plays the
skunk he’s got to get his med’cine short. You get
that?”</p>

<p>Jim made no reply, but the look in his eyes was sufficient.</p>

<p>“Well, here it is,” Len went on quickly. “If we dope
this stuff out free we’ll break the market, and set every
news-sheet shouting from one end of the world to the
other. And the folks’ll jump in an’ shut us down.
We’re sort of in the position of the feller who can
transmute base metal. No. When we’ve a big enough
bunch of stuff out I’m going to take a big trip down
to Perth. I’m going to get a guy with a tramp ship,
a Windjammer for preference. I’m going to fix up
with him; he’ll get a handsome commission on our
trade of gold, and I’m going to bring him along up
and have him stand off down the coast a few miles,
an’ then, with this old barge of ours, I’ll come along
and pick up all we got, an’ haul it back aboard of his
ship. Then you’re going right along with him and the
stuff, and you’re going to travel from port to port and
dispose of it for credit at such banks as will trade in
smallish parcels. And meanwhile, I’ll stop right here
on this coast an’ get stuff out ready for when you come
back. Then I’ll take a trip, an’ you’ll stop around. An’
when we’ve sold all we need we’ll&mdash;quit. It’s the only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
way, Jim. We got to play the smugglin’ game, an’ play
it good. We got to take chances. Mighty big chances!
I got to trust you, an’ you got to trust me, an’ we got
to trust that skipper by makin’ it worth his while an’
keeping a gun pushed ready. Ther’s got to be no
weakening. It’s the only way I can see to put our
play through. Otherwise, our gold ain’t worth hell
room to us. Do you see it? Are you on? I want
you to make that first trip because you got folks needing
you worse than any one needs me. That’s one
reason. The other is I want you to feel I’m putting
right into your hands my share, and I’m not worrying
a thing because that’s so. See? We know each other.
We’re on the square. An’ the thing I want from you
is to keep the commission guy on the same angle.
Well?”</p>

<p>“It’s the sort o’ thing I had in mind, Len, only I
hadn’t got it clear like you.”</p>

<p>Jim knocked out his pipe and stood up stretching
himself, while he gazed out over the flat calm of the
bay.</p>

<p>“It goes. Sure it does,” he said readily. “An’ I’m
glad for that thought that made you have me make the
first trip. It’s kind of generous, Len. But it’s like
you. Gee, I’m sick of this coast! Say, can you beat
it? Here we are, two fellers takin’ every chance in
life to make an honest grub stake out of no-man’s
land, and to do that we got to hunt our holes like
gophers, lest folks get wise to us an’ snatch it from us.
It sort of makes you wonder. But you know, Len,
this river’s too rich. I sort of feel that. I kind of feel
the thing’s not goin’ to be as easy as you make it seem.
But we’re goin’ to see it through to the end. An’ God
help the feller that starts in to rob us! Yes, it’s a kind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
thought of yours, sending me on the first trip. I got
a mother an’ a dandy sister who’ll likely bless you for
this. I guess they’re hard put all right, and the
thought’s had me worried for months. Say&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>He turned towards the river and glanced up at the
sky. Len laughed.</p>

<p>“That’s all right, Jim. I’m ready all the time,” he
said. “It ain’t work gettin’ back on the river. It’s
play. Come on. We’re going to get out half a ton of
stuff,” he laughed, as he sprang to his feet. “Then
I’ll make Perth, an’ buy up that tramp skipper.”</p>

<p>He moved off beside his partner, leaving his golden
pile just where it lay. And together they passed out of
the shelter of the trees.</p>

<span class="fs95">The Headland</span></h2>


<p class="drop-capy1">THE woman was standing in the doorway of her
log-built home. She was gazing out over the
waters of the creek below her which flowed gently on
to the distant Alsek River. A mood of quiet contemplative
happiness was shining in her dark eyes. It
was the mother soul in her that was stirred to a deep
sense of happy satisfaction.</p>

<p>Rebecca Carver was a smallish, sturdy, vigorous
creature something past the middle of life. She had
lived hardly enough in the harsh Alaskan territory that
had bred her and had always remained her home. And
even now, with advancing years, and a body sometimes
only barely equal to the onslaught of its pitiless climate,
she had not even a momentary desire to leave it.</p>

<p>But then she had not lived unhappily. The years of
her wifehood had been passed in the exciting, many-coloured,
chequered life which ever falls to the lot of
those who devote themselves to the crazy uncertainties
of the quest of gold. No. Her life had never been
monotonous. And besides the excitement of it all she
had had her son, and daughter, and her man, and these
alone would have been sufficient to keep an atmosphere
of smiling contentment in her woman’s heart.</p>

<p>Now, however, her man had long since gone. Her
son was far away, fending for them and himself as
best he might. She only had her daughter remaining
with her, but the girl was the pride and joy of her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
loyal heart; a blue-eyed, beautiful creature who never
failed to remind her, to her contented satisfaction, of
the cheerful, reckless, gambling husband who had been
her strong support in the hard years of their life together.</p>

<p>Circumstances were hard-pressing with her now.
They had pressed heavily ever since the death of her
husband. The future was full enough of threat to
depress the stoutest heart. But, for the moment, she
was not concerned with these things. It was the
thought of her boy, her first-born, that filled her
yearning soul with happiness. Only that morning her
daughter had brought her out a letter from Beacon
Glory. It was a letter at long last from Jim. And the
tidings it yielded were of the best.</p>

<p>The day was utterly grey with the herald of coming
winter. There had been no sun to relieve the dark-hued
forests on the hills which rose up on every side
about her. The blistering summer heat had long since
reduced all vegetation to the russet hues of fall, and
even the great forests of jack-pine had lost something
of the intensity of their evergreen hues. Somewhere
behind her, hidden by a rampart of iron-bound coast,
lay the open seas of the North Pacific. For the rest,
to the North, and East, and South, lay the tattered
world of broken foothills which were the fringe of
the greater hills beyond. She knew it all by heart, this
world of southern Alaska which had always been her
home, and for all the overwhelming nature of it, for
all the threat of the heavy grey sky, she feared nothing
it could show her. And now, perhaps, less than ever.</p>

<p>She abruptly withdrew her gaze from the tumultuous
scene of it all. She dived into the capacious pocket of
her rough skirt. When her hand was withdrawn it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
grasping the neatly folded pages of a letter in a big,
scrawling handwriting. She unfolded them and became
deeply absorbed. She almost knew the contents
of the letter by heart, but somehow she felt she could
never read it often enough.</p>

<p>The letter was vaguely headed “Australia.” It was
without date, but this she had ascertained from its
postmark, as she had also ascertained that it had been
mailed in a city she had barely cognisance of, called
“Perth.”</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="noindent">
<span class="smcap">Dearest Mother</span>:<br />
</p>

<p class="noindent">We’ve made good. We’ve made so good I can’t begin to
tell you about it.</p></div>

<p>Just for a moment a deep sigh of happiness escaped
the mother’s lips, and something like tears of emotion
half-filled her eyes. She brushed them aside promptly,
however, and continued her reading.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="noindent">I don’t know the date so I can’t hand it to you. I can’t
hand you our whereabouts either, but for different reasons.
What I can tell you is I’m setting right out for home as soon
as Len gets along back, which’ll maybe in six weeks. He’s
taking this letter with him, an’ will mail it, which’ll maybe in
two or three weeks’ time. I’ll be setting out in a windjammer
called the <i>Imperial</i> of Bristol. When you read the
name you’ll wonder to see it in Len’s handwriting, but you
see he’s taking the letter, and we don’t know the name of the
ship till he gets to his destination and charters it, see? So
he’ll have to fill the name in. This’ll all seem kind of mysterious
to you, but it don’t matter. The thing is, I’m coming
right along home to you, an’ll reach you in about six months’
time, with enough stuff so you’ll never have to worry a thing
again ever.</p></div>

<p>The letter went on for several pages, filled to the brim
with that kindly, intimate talk which never fails to stir<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
the depths of a mother’s heart. And so Rebecca
Carver read it all once again, revelling in the delight
with which the words of her boy filled her.</p>

<p>Jim had made good! Jim was returning home! He
was crazy to be with her and his sister Claire again.
Oh, it was good, so good! The woman’s brown eyes
were raised smiling whimsically at the sudden thought
which her mood had inspired. Why, it was all so
good that she would almost joyfully accept whatever
offer Bad Booker might make for their last block of
real estate in the city of Beacon Glory, which now
represented their entire resources for the coming winter.
Yes, never in her life had she been so thrilled.
Never!</p>

<p>She remembered earlier thrills. She remembered
those hard times when they had been well-nigh confronted
with starvation. She remembered how her
husband, that headlong gambler, had set out to the
gaming tables of Beacon Glory with their last remaining
dollars in his pocket. And she had sat at home
with her half-fed children awaiting his return. Then
the joy of his return with pockets bulging&mdash;yes, those
had been great moments. But then he was a skilful
gambler and rarely failed. This&mdash;this was something
on a different plane. Something&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Her contemplative gaze had discovered movement
on the hillside across the water. It was a horse-drawn
vehicle moving rapidly, descending the precipitate slope
diagonally at the break of the forest which gave way
to the bald, wind-swept crest above. Its course would
bring it down to the far side of the ford of the river
directly opposite where she was standing.</p>

<p>Her smile deepened. It needed no second thought
to tell her whose vehicle it was. Ivor McLagan, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
oil man from the Alsek River, was on his way into
Beacon Glory, which lay ten miles or so to the northeast
of her home.</p>

<p>She awaited his arrival. He was a welcome enough
visitor at all times. And he never failed to call in on
his way, and leave her any newspapers he might chance
to have. He was wealthy, and a man everybody esteemed.
She had sometimes hoped&mdash;&mdash; But she knew
that could never be. Claire was a girl of strong decision
for all she was only twenty-one. She had already
definitely refused to marry him. She liked him
well enough. They all liked him. Especially had Jim
liked him, but it was her woman’s understanding of the
position that made her fear that Claire’s frank regard
would never deepen to anything warmer.</p>

<p>The buckboard seemed to be almost falling down
the precipitous slope under the man’s reckless handling.
It was literally plunging headlong, but she understood&mdash;she
knew. It was McLagan’s way with his
Alaskan bronchos. There would be no disaster. And
as she watched his progress she wanted to laugh, for
such was the lightness of her mood.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The buckboard rattled, and shook, and jolted as it
bustled down the hillside over a broken almost undefined
trail. Its surefooted, well-fed team was utterly
untiring. The shaggy creatures made no mistakes.
Tough, hardy, they were bred to just such work as this,
and they were in the hands of a super-teamster. So
the creek came up to them with a rush and they plunged
belly deep into the chill water of the ford. Then, moments
later, they were reined in sharply at the door of
the man’s familiar stopping place.</p>

<p>“Say, ma’am, this country’s one hell of a proposition<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
for a quiet, decent, comfort-loving, ordinary sort of
<ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Period added after 'ordinary sort of engineer'">engineer</ins>.”</p>

<p>The man’s greeting was full of cheer, and his smiling
eyes conveyed a quiet sense of dry humour. Ivor
McLagan had no claims to good looks, and his manner
ordinarily was sufficiently brusque to border on rudeness,
but in this woman’s presence he had a way of displaying
a side to his character that those who met him
in business, those of his own sex, were never admitted
to. No, McLagan had nothing in face or feature to
thrill any woman’s artist soul, but what he lacked in
that direction he made up in another. As he turned
his buckboard wheels and leapt to the ground, he towered
over the little woman in the doorway a figure of
magnificent manhood.</p>

<p>Rebecca’s eyes smiled up at him responsively.</p>

<p>“It surely is, Ivor. But I don’t mind a thing. Jim’s
coming right back to me. He’s made good, he and
Len, an’ he’s coming home with stuff so we’ll never
need to worry ever again.”</p>

<p>It was out. The mother had to tell her glorious
news on the instant. And to this old friend of her
Jim’s of all men.</p>

<p>Ivor nodded. Then came the quiet, conventional
reply, “You don’t say?”</p>

<p>The woman’s excitement rose. “But I surely do,”
she cried, holding up the bundled pages of her letter.
“It’s all right here. This is mail I got from him this
morning. Claire brought it out from Beacon, bless
her! My, I&mdash;I sort of feel just anyhow. Ever feel
that way? Ever feel you wanted to dance around an’
shout? Say&mdash;but come right in an’ get some coffee.
It’s on the stove. I&mdash;I’m forgettin’ everything.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span></p>

<p>Ivor shook his head.</p>

<p>“Don’t you worry, ma’am,” he said in a tone of sympathy
one would never have associated with him.
“Just get busy an’&mdash;shout. But tell me first, when’s
Jim getting along?”</p>

<p>“Guess he’s right on the way now.” The woman’s
eyes were alight, then a shadow crept into them. “He
won’t be along for six months from the start. Maybe
that’ll be three months an’ more from the coming of
this letter.”</p>

<p>“Yes, it would be about that.”</p>

<p>The man’s eyes were serious as he regarded the letter
bunched in Rebecca’s hand. Then he looked up and
was smiling again.</p>

<p>“I’m just so glad for you, ma’am, I can’t say,” he
said cordially. “Jim’s a great boy. He’s got elegant grit,
too. He’s out for you an’ Claire all the time, and I’ll
be real glad to have him around again for&mdash;for all
your sakes. How does Claire feel? But there, I guess
she’s crazy glad. Where is she?”</p>

<p>He craned, peering into the doorway expectantly.
But the mother shook her head.</p>

<p>“She’s not inside,” she declared. “Glad? Why, it
don’t say a thing, Ivor. You know her. She and
Jim are kind of all in all to themselves. She went sort
of white as a corpse when she read that letter. She
didn’t say much, but if you’d seen her eyes! My!
You can guess wher’ she is now. Ther’s only one
place for Claire when Jim’s on the water sailin’ home.
It’s right up on the headland back of here,” she jerked
her greying head towards the back of the house.
“She’s right up there where she can see the sea. An’
I guess she’s dreaming fool dreams of his home-coming.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes, I guess it’s kind of wonderful for you both,”
Ivor said kindly.</p>

<p>“Wonderful? Sure it is. Ther’s another thing.
We been kind of in bad shape an’ were selling out our
last block in Beacon that my man left to us. Oh, I’m
not really thinkin’ of the stuff he’s bringing. No,”
Rebecca went on, as though she feared the man might
think that sheer selfishness was the substance of her
delight. “But it helps. And Claire’s been a heap worried
dealing with Bad Booker, but it don’t matter a
thing now. We’ll take what he offers an’ be thankful.”</p>

<p>Ivor had turned to his horses. He unloosed the
halter shank of the nearside beast and secured it to the
tying ring on the log wall of the house, then he drew
out a bundle of well-read newspapers and held them
out to Rebecca.</p>

<p>“Here, take these,” he said in his quick, rough way.
“I’ll leave my plugs right here. They’ll be glad to
stand. I’m just going up to get a word with Claire.
I’ll bring her right along down.”</p>

<p>The mother took the papers and threw them on to
the table in the room behind her. Somehow her usual
interest in them was overwhelmed.</p>

<p>“Thanks, Ivor,” she said. “You never seem to forget
us. I’ll sure be real glad to have you bring Claire
down with you. She’s crazy glad, sure&mdash;we both are,
but it don’t seem time to me to be dreaming around on
any old hill-tops. I’ll set coffee an’ a bite to eat against
you get back.”</p>

<p>She watched him hurry away, this great creature all
height, and muscle, and plainness of feature. She
realised his eagerness, and again there arose in her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
mother heart that hope which her better sense sought
to deny her.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The girl was gazing out upon the distant sea. The
iron-bound coast that lay immediately below her made
no claim upon her, for all the wild beauty, the cruel
austerity with which its ages-long battle with the
merciless waters of a storm-swept ocean had endowed
it. Neither had the panorama of tumultuous hills
which rose about her, nor the distant snowy crests of
the northern reaches of the Rocky Mountains any appeal.
She only had eyes for the grey, far-off horizon
where sky and sea met. She was searching for some
sign of a sail, which, in fancy, she might translate into
the wings of the vessel bringing home a beloved brother
and&mdash;fortune.</p>

<p>She was beautifully tall and slim, for all her somewhat
rough clothing which had little more than
warmth and utility to recommend it. It was the best
that the joint efforts of her mother and herself had
been able to contrive out of their limited resources,
and the girl was not given to grumbling. No, she
was accustomed to hardships, and self-denial came easy
to her. She was too strong and resolute, she was too
frankly generous to harbour any petty resentment
against her lot.</p>

<p>In twenty-one years she had grown to superb womanhood,
healthy in mind, healthy in a wonderful degree
in body. Her father had seen something of her splendid
development before he died, but it was left to her
mother to witness the final reality of it. To the latter
her child was the most beautiful creature in all the
world. Her wide blue eyes, and her wealth of flaming<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
red hair, her shapely body, so tall, and vigorous,
and straight; then her sun-tanned, rounded cheeks,
and her well-chiselled nose, and broad, even brows;
were they not all something of a reflection of the early
youth of the man who had given her her own life’s
happiness? Time and again her mother had rejoiced
that she had had her christened with so choice a name
as “St. Claire.” True, the “Saint” had been permitted
to fall into disuse. But it still belonged to her, and
nothing could rob her of it. And the mother only
regretted that the girl herself refused to permit its
revival.</p>

<p>Just now the girl had given herself up to idle moments
of delicious dreaming. And why not? Difficulties
and troubles had beset them for so long; oh,
yes. She had no scruple in admitting the bald, hard
truth. Not alone was her joy at the prospect of Jim’s
return. He was returning with some sort of fortune,
for them as well as himself.</p>

<p>It would mean so much to them. Her mother would
know ease and peace of mind after all her heroic struggles
with adversity. Jim would be freed from his
great responsibility for their care. And she&mdash;she&mdash;well,
there were so many great and wonderful things
in the world she wanted to do and see.</p>

<p>And dreaming of all that this splendid return meant
to them her mind went back to the interview she had
had only that morning in Beacon Glory with the man
everybody called “Bad” Booker, the chief real estate
man in the city.</p>

<p>Her journey into town had been inspired by their
necessity. Her mother still owned a small block of
property in Beacon Glory, the last remaining asset left<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
to her by her gambler husband. It was mortgaged to
Booker, himself, but only lightly, and she had visited
him to endeavour to sell it right out. Without Booker’s
help they possessed less than twenty dollars with which
to face the winter, and await Jim’s return. She took
no account of the played-out gold claim on the creek
below her. That had ceased to yield a pennyweight
of gold more than two years back, a fact which had
been the inspiration of her brother’s going.</p>

<p>She remembered Booker’s smiling fat face and bald
head as she offered him her proposition. He always
smiled, and it was a hateful, greasy, fixed sort of smile.
She believed he was a Jew. But Jew or Gentile, he was
a merciless money-spinner, ready to rob the world of
its last dollar.</p>

<p>Her anger surged even now with her thought of the
man. He had offered to take the block off her mother’s
hands for two thousand dollars cash. It was the limit
to which he would go. It was mortgaged for two
thousand dollars to him. It was in the very centre of
Beacon Glory, next to the Speedway Dance Hall. And
even though the city was dead flat as a reaction from
its early boom, the property was worth not a cent less
than ten thousand dollars. It was maddening. It was
a sheer “hold-up.” But she knew they were helpless
in the man’s hands. Oh, if they could only tide over
until Jim got back!</p>

<p>She had told her mother not a word of the man’s
offer yet. Somehow she felt she had not the courage
to tell her. Yet she would have to do so, and, worst
of all, she knew they would have to accept the man’s
offer or starve.</p>

<p>Well, she would have one slight consolation. Once<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
the deed was signed, and the money was in her hands,
she would tell “Bad” Booker all that was in her mind.
She&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>The sound of a footstep behind her broke up the
half-fierce, almost tearful train of her thought. She
turned sharply to discover Ivor McLagan breathing
heavily after his climb.</p>

<p>“Say, Claire,” he cried, while he spread out his hands
deprecatingly, and his smallish eyes twinkled humorously,
“why in the name of everything holy make this
darn country worse than it is? Why you need to climb
a mile high to enjoy the thought of your Jim, boy, coming
along, I just can’t see. I surely can’t!” Then
he glanced quickly out to sea and took a deep breath.
“My, but this is a swell spot!” he added soberly.</p>

<p>The girl’s bad time had passed. Her smile came on
the instant.</p>

<p>“That’s quite a contradiction,” she said slily.</p>

<p>“Sure. Well, we’ll cut the first part right out.”
McLagan’s twinkling gaze came back to the girl’s face,
and he drank in the fresh beauty of it. “I couldn’t
pass along into that nightmare city of ours without
speaking my piece of gladness for your news. It’s
bully! It certainly is. The boy’s made good. An’ for
you folks, I guess, only just in time.”</p>

<p>The girl nodded as she looked up into the man’s
plain face, and a flash of thoughtful regret for its
plainness broke in on all the rest that preoccupied her.</p>

<p>“I doubt if it’s even that, Ivor,” she said, a little
desperately.</p>

<p>“How?”</p>

<p>The man’s interrogation was a return to his roughness
of manner.</p>

<p>“Why, Bad Booker’s got us right in his clutches, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
we can’t even wriggle. He reckons to hand Mum two
thousand on top of his two thousand mortgage for
a block of stuff you could market free for ten thousand.
It’s his two thousand or&mdash;or starve.”</p>

<p>The girl finished up with a smile that failed to hide
her feelings, and McLagan’s eyes hardened.</p>

<p>“The man’s a swine,” he said, and his voice grated
harshly.</p>

<p>“That don’t help.”</p>

<p>“No. Don’t accept, Claire. Don’t you sell.”</p>

<p>“But we’ve got to eat.”</p>

<p>“Sure, an’ you’re going to. Here.” Just for a
second the man hesitated, and shifted his gaze from
the beautiful urgent face that never more deeply appealed
to him than now. Then it came back on the
instant. “It’s no use,” he cried, and his tone was
rough. “You’re not going to starve. You and your
mother can have all the cash you need till Jim comes,
and&mdash;and I want nothing in return. Do you get my
meaning, Claire? If you take money on loan from
me till Jim gets home you’ll never have need to worry.
You can just shut it right out of your head and forget
it&mdash;till Jim comes home. I mean that just plain an’
straight. And there isn’t a thing behind it.”</p>

<p>They stood eye to eye while the girl swiftly read the
sheer honesty lying behind the man’s eyes. Then she
shook her head.</p>

<p>“No,” she said, “I’m going to sell. I’m going to sell,
and I’ll just wait around after, hoping for the day to
come when the Aurora Clan will reckon that Bad
Booker’s a sort of nightmare disease an’ needs plenty
good med’cine. Thanks, Ivor. It’s just a real kind
thought of yours, and the thing that makes me glad is
I know you mean it just as you’ve said it. But I don’t<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
want your money. I&mdash;I wouldn’t take it if it was that
or&mdash;or starve.”</p>

<p>For all there was something of roughness in the
girl’s choice of words for her refusal, there was none
in her manner. Even her hope that one day Booker
would receive his medicine at the hands of the secret
Aurora Clan was without undue feeling. The man was
deeply stirred.</p>

<p>They were great friends, these two. But for the
man’s peace of mind the frank nature of their friendship
was deplorable. He loved the girl with all the
strength of his manhood. He held a big position with
the Mountain Oil Corporation of Ohio as their consulting
engineer, and his whole desire was to take this
child of the northern wilderness away to his far-off
home in the sunlit valleys of California. She had
refused to marry him more than once. But somehow
her refusal had left their friendship unaffected. She
liked him whole-heartedly in a manner that to her precluded
all possibility of regard of a deeper nature, but
which in the man only contrived to strengthen his natural
persistence.</p>

<p>The leaping fires of the man’s passion surged up in
face of the rebuff. For a brief moment he contemplated
the smiling eyes in their wonderful framing of
vivid hair, which the slouch-brimmed hat she was wearing
failed to conceal. Then his lips obeyed his impulse.</p>

<p>“Yes, I know, Claire,” he said, his voice harshened
by emotion. “You won’t, you can’t accept my help.
Why? I’ll tell you. Because I don’t belong to you.
Because I want to marry you, am crazy with love for
you, and you don’t feel like falling for my notion. So
you can’t have the thing I want to do for you like I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
never wanted to do for anybody ever before. I guess
you’re right enough in your own lights, sure you are.
You’re not putting yourself under obligation to the
feller you don’t fancy to marry. But why not marry
me, Claire? Maybe I’m not a thing of beauty. But I
guess I just love you to death. Maybe you don’t care a
thing for the picture I make now, but you’ll get used to
it. Sure you will.” He laughed a little bitterly. “I
guess folks can get used to most things after a while.”
Then his smile passed. “But, my dear, ther’s not a
thing in the world I wouldn’t do to give you a real dandy
life. These oil wells out here are going to pass me a
fortune that I’m crazy to share with you. Won’t you?
No. You won’t. I can see it in your eyes, the same
as I’ve seen it before. But&mdash;but if I’ve still got to
stand for that, there’s things I won’t stand for. You
need help and I’ll raise all the hell I can to pass it you.”</p>

<p>Claire shook her head a shade impatiently.</p>

<p>“It’s no use, Ivor. Why&mdash;why can’t we be friends?
True, I haven’t a thing against you in the world, not a
thing, not even”&mdash;she smiled gently&mdash;“the looks which
you don’t seem to set much stock by. No, it isn’t
anything like that. True it isn’t. I like you, but&mdash;&mdash;
Here, you don’t get the things lying back of my
fool head. Guess I’m my father’s daughter. You
knew him for what he was. He was a gambler. And
maybe, in a way, I’m a gambler, too. I want life with
all its chances. I want to reach out an’ hug it all. I
want to take every chance coming, and do something,
and be something in the game of it all. I don’t want
to marry. Sure not yet. I don’t want to share in any
man’s home, and&mdash;and grow on like a cabbage.
There’s too much of the big adventure in life for me to
miss it all. Maybe I’ll get sort of disillusioned later&mdash;maybe.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
I can’t help that. But I mean to take a hand
in the game meanwhile.”</p>

<p>There was such a ring of final resolution in the
girl’s smiling denial that the man realised his momentary
defeat. So he offered no further protest.
He made no attempt at argument. He shrugged his
great shoulders, and the happy twinkle returned to his
eyes.</p>

<p>“Don’t say another word, Claire,” he said gently.
“Maybe I understand the thing lying back of your
mind. Forget my break. It was a bad one, and I
shouldn’t have made it, but&mdash;but I sort of just had to.
I won’t do it again. There isn’t some other feller, is
there?”</p>

<p>The girl laughed happily in her relief at his manner.</p>

<p>“Not a soul,” she cried, unhesitatingly.</p>

<p>“That’s all right.” The man’s eyes smiled responsively.
“I can wait. I’m going to, and I’ll make no
more bad breaks. And maybe when you’ve hit your
adventures, and kind of tired of them, and feel you’d
like the rest you’ll have maybe earned, why I’ll be
waiting around, and I’ll surely be ready to hand it you
when you raise a finger, a sign. An’ meanwhile, my
dear, I’d be glad to have you feel ther’s no sort of
trouble in the world so big I wouldn’t be glad to smooth
out for you.” He suddenly spread out his muscular
hands. “These two hands are for you, night or day,
all the time, and I’ve two ears that’ll hear the faintest
whisper of trouble that’s worrying you. Say, come
along right down. Your mother’s crazy to talk your
Jim to you and she asked me to bring you to home.”</p>

<p>The man’s whole manner was so gentle as to be
irresistible. For all the thing that lay between them
there had never been a moment when he had made so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
great an appeal to the girl. His normal roughness she
knew to be but an unfortunate garment in which he
clothed himself. Now, as times before, she was listening
to the real man so surely hidden from the world
that looked on. She was not without a shadow of
regret that she could not see in him the man of her
desire. Without a word of protest she permitted him
to lead the way down from the bald crest of the headland.</p>

<span class="fs95">In Beacon Glory</span></h2>


<p class="drop-capy1">IVOR McLAGAN eased his great body in the groaning
wicker chair, and his eyes snapped with something
like irritation. The long, lean cigar it was his
habit to smoke he removed from between his lips, and
indicated the main thoroughfare beyond the window
behind him.</p>

<p>“Don’t tell me you’ve a hunch for this muck-hole,
Victor,” he said sharply. “Take a pull at yourself,
man. Get a cold douche, if you can find a thing so
wholesome in Beacon Glory, and wake yourself right
up. Take a look out there. Take a peek around you,
and if you aren’t as blind as a dead mule, and a sure
candidate for the foolish place, you’ll see this darnation
monument to human vanity as it is. I tell you there’s
no sort of limit to human vanity when it gets a-riot
fixing cities. Beacon Glory? Did you ever call a hogpen
by any other fancy name? Sure you didn’t. You
aren’t plumb crazed yet for all you’re talking this burg
as though winter had no right hiding it up for six
months of the year. Get a look at the garbage lying
around even the business avenue. Avenue! Sounds
fine, doesn’t it? And then think of the hell of flies and
skitters you got to live through next summer. Look
at the shanties lying scattered around desecrating a
swell picture of Nature’s painting. They’re enough to
insult a half-breed settlement that don’t know better.
But that’s no circumstance to the folks who’re to blame<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
for despoiling God Almighty’s decent earth with a
pestilential collection of man’s assorted junk. The
moral atmosphere of Beacon Glory would leave the
hottest oven in hell hollering. There’s more dirt an’
dishonesty to the square inch in Beacon Glory than
you’d ever find in any mediæval Turkish penitentiary,
kept especially for housing the folks they don’t like the
faces of. And they call this quagmire of corruption
‘Beacon Glory’! They laid it out in Avenues! They
filled it up with garbage an’ human junk, an’ folk like
you sit around with your hat in one hand and the other
on your left chest and breathe the word ‘city’ in the
sort of tone you’d hand out over a deathbed. That’s
you, who don’t belong to it. You, who aren’t any sort
of part of it, except you’re here to collect any stray
gold lying around, and pass it back to your home city.
You, a banker! My, it’s queer how folks can fall for
their surroundings!”</p>

<p>Victor Burns laughed cordially at his friend’s diatribe.
It amused him thoroughly. McLagan was on
his pet theme, which was an utter contempt and detestation
of the city of Beacon Glory.</p>

<p>“That’s all right, Ivor,” he said. “You can’t run a
branch of your bank and shout at the folks you do
business with. For just as long as it’s my job collecting
the dust folks don’t know better than to waste their
lives chasing, Beacon Glory’s a deal bigger than ‘ace
high’ to me. It’s a swell city that does a mighty big
credit to the folks whose enterprise set it up&mdash;and
made my living possible. You’re collecting oil in the
big valleys, which is liable to leave you finding a queer
sort of human fog lying about our principal avenue,
but I’d like to say the ‘muck-hole’ of Beacon Glory
don’t hurt your prospect a cent, and you’d miss its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
‘beauties’ if the foolish ones had never dumped it
down.”</p>

<p>McLagan laughed good-naturedly, and returned his
cigar to its place in the corner of his capacious mouth.
They were lounging in the office of Beacon Glory’s
principal hotel, this engineer of the Mountain Oil
Corporation and the chief banker of the place. They
were something more than business acquaintances. A
pleasant friendship existed between them, inspired perhaps
by mutual esteem for the other’s integrity in surroundings
which each knew to be something morally
deplorable.</p>

<p>The hotel&mdash;the Plaza by name&mdash;was an angular
three-storied, wooden-frame building that had once
been well and truly painted. But that was in the boom
days. It had a verandah fronting on the city’s only
business avenue, a long, unpaved thoroughfare that
had wrecked the running gear of more vehicles in its
time than any roadway the world had ever known.
Over the verandah, on a level with the first floor, was
a wide balcony of similar proportions. In the heyday
of prosperity this had been covered by a brilliant
striped awning, but that, like the outside paint, had
long since yielded to the weather. But for all its
dreary, derelict appearance the Plaza stood out amongst
the rest of the city’s buildings, with one or two exceptions,
as something rather magnificent, if only for
its proportions.</p>

<p>McLagan and the banker had the office with its decayed
furniture and spluttering wood stove to themselves.
That is, they only shared it with its atmosphere
of general uncleanness. It was the hour immediately
before supper, a meal which Abe Cranfield’s fly-blown
menu described as “dinner,” a title his boarders refused<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
to accept. Soon contingents of humanity would
foregather in anticipation of a meal to sustain stomachs
which had long since learned to satisfy themselves
on a diet of unsavoury monotony.</p>

<p>“That’s all right, Victor,” McLagan said readily.
“You’re a banker, I’m not. I’m just a hard citizen the
same as the rest, and don’t need to worry to keep my
notions of Beacon Glory to myself. And if any feller
feels like disputing, why, I can argue it out any old
way he fancies. But I’m sick with this city the
same as I’m sick with most things unclean. I guess
it isn’t altogether the fault of folks so much as
the times, and the thing life’s drifted into. Does it
ever worry you thinking of modern conditions and
the crazy scramble of it all? You know, I ought
to’ve been born two or three centuries back before
some fool guy invented the words ‘democracy’ and
‘proletariat.’ You can’t run a thing right by committees
and assemblies set up by any popular vote. Think
of me trying to locate oil in the hills back here with a
bunch of guys sitting around telling me how I need to
go about it, and where to start my drills. No, sir.
It’s the same with countries and cities and Sunday
schools. You need one head and one hand. And
whether for good or bad you’ll get some sort of order
and discipline and things’ll move quick. I’d say it’s
better, seeing human nature is what it is, to let one feller
graft than a government of hundreds, and it’s cheaper.
This territory’s run by a government that only cares
for its job and legislates thousands of miles away.
What’s the result? Why&mdash;Beacon Glory, an undisciplined
quagmire of human muck!”</p>

<p>Victor Burns lit a cigarette and grinned through the
smoke. He was a small, round, sleek little man, clean-shaven<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
and with a pleasant face that looked to be made
for smiling. He was almost in ridiculous contrast to
the huge frame and rugged exterior of the other.</p>

<p>“That’s all so, all right,” Burns nodded. “I’ve
thought heaps more than that lying awake at nights
wondering how far the other feller’s got me beat. But
a grouch in this office isn’t going to fix things right.”
He glanced alertly round the room which still remained
empty. “And that’s why I’m kind of glad for that
bunch of boys who got together to try and clean things
up. It don’t matter to me who or what the folks of the
Aurora Clan are, or the ultimate purpose lying back of
their game. They started out a year ago to clean
things up some and they got half the toughs of this
burg scared to foolishness. There hasn’t been a hold-up
in months, and only a week back these white-gowned
purifiers burnt out stark that drug den of Bernard’s
where Charlie O’Byrne was done to death for his wad.
Say, those boys are right if they just stick right to the
game they started on. The danger is, when they got
Beacon where they need it and have cleaned up the
tougher stuff of the place, they may be looking for payment.”</p>

<p>Ivor shook his head.</p>

<p>“You never can tell, Victor,” he said seriously.
“They’re a terror to the muck of this place now, I agree.
Maybe later they’ll be a terror, anyway, that’s the way
of these things. So long as they act the way they are
we’re all glad, we must be. Any feller with a wide
mind would be crazy to feel bad about them, but,” he
shook his head and flung the stump of his cigar almost
viciously into the stove, “maybe it’ll just drift into the
usual. With the others out of the way they’ll do the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
hold-up. Then the Government, thousands of miles
away’ll butt in. The Aurora Clan will get cleaned
right up and back we’ll fall into the muck those boys
did their best to haul us out of. No, I’ve a brief for
them. I surely have. But when they’ve done their
work and start getting gay for themselves, I’ll be as
ready as any one to start cleaning them up. It’s a hell
of a place, anyway!”</p>

<p>McLagan remained gazing into the stove with eyes
that had lost their usual twinkle. He was a man of
immense resolution and capacity. A brilliant mining
engineer, he yearned for wider scope in the affairs of
life. So far all his energies had been directed to the
earth’s remote places, seeking those treasures for his
Corporation which at any cost must be acquired for
the purposes of satisfying voracious shareholders.
And Victor Burns, watching him, understood something
of the restless, dissatisfied spirit driving him.
He was a shrewd judge of men, as are most real
bankers, and this burly, plain creature, all energy and
capacity, more than usually interested him.</p>

<p>“How’s oil?” he asked quietly, as the other remained
silent.</p>

<p>“Just about the same.” Ivor laughed in his short
way. “Oh, it’s there all right. It’s there plenty. The
Alsek valley’s full of it&mdash;when we can reach it. That’s
one of the things makes me feel bad for this place.
When we strike it, as we’re sure to, the old gold boom
that bred this city won’t be any sort of circumstance.”</p>

<p>“When’ll that be?”</p>

<p>Burns’ eyes were shrewdly inquiring. It was his
business to be well-informed.</p>

<p>“Any old time, maybe a month, maybe two years.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
McLagan shook his head. “You can’t just say. But
two years from now is our limit. That’ll make a
seven-year prospect.”</p>

<p>“I see.” Burns nodded and glanced round. The
door had opened to admit the first arrival of the boarders.
“Well, we need it. There’s some gold flowing in
slowly from the country. But things are dead flat,
and I can’t even begin to guess where the folks collect
the dollars spent at the Speedway every night. Max,
there, tells me he’s looking to a big spending winter,
but I don’t see how he figures it. Howdy, Tilbury,”
he nodded at the new arrival. “Where’s your partner,
Allison?”</p>

<p>The newcomer, slight, short and with greying hair,
nodded back a greeting.</p>

<p>“Oh, I guess he’s on the bum around. He’ll be
along. Glad to see you, Mr. McLagan,” he said, turning
quickly and almost deferentially to the engineer.
“Opened up a gusher yet?”</p>

<p>McLagan’s eyes twinkled as he rose from his protesting
chair.</p>

<p>“Guess I’ll be asked that haf a century of times
before the night’s out. No, boy,” he said. “The old
earth’s holding up her secrets and looks like holding
’em years. An’ say, you’ll be doing me real service
putting that news around when the boys come in to
feed. Put it round quick, while I go and wash. Travelling’s
a mighty dirty pastime around Beacon Glory,
which is only reasonable.” And he passed out of the
office just as a distant bell rang announcing the evening
meal.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>“Bad” Booker was sitting in his private room behind
the outer office. It was a comfortable apartment, almost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
sumptuous, and seemed to be the natural setting
for the personality of this real estate man. He was a
heavy creature with a flowing moustache, of which, to
judge by the inordinate care he bestowed upon it, he
was exceedingly proud. He was fat and everything
about him was gross. His general appearance and
manner were of extreme good nature, and his smile
to this end was of a quality admirably calculated to
emphasise it. But Beacon Glory knew the man because,
whatever other things Beacon Glory may have
lacked, it had a swift estimate of those who were part
of its public life. Those whose misfortune made it
necessary to come into business contact with Bad
Booker hated and detested the man, and more particularly
his smile, for they quickly found that the real
estate mask was incapable of long concealing the ugly
features of the usurer underneath.</p>

<p>He was smoking a pungent Turkish cigarette liberally
besprinkled with gold lettering, and the while he
was studying the extensive deed of title relating to a
corner block in the chief avenue of the city. An air
of calm satisfaction pervaded the man, for he knew
that the property under consideration was about to
fall into his hands at a price which even he regarded as
advantageous. It was what he desired.</p>

<p>He was a shrewd creature with a wide vision in the
matter of self-interest. Whatever others might think
of Beacon Glory, he, at least, had no doubts. He realised
with absolute certainty that the place was there
to stay. It was within twenty miles of a fine, wide
harbour for shipping from the South. It was built on
the shores of a large lake whose name, since the city’s
building, had become associated with the place, and it
occupied a site in the heart of a splendid valley which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
ran right down to the sea and was the highway to the
interior of Alaska through the otherwise almost impassable
world of the southern hills. It was the centre
of a gold region that was as yet in its infancy. Furthermore,
there was coal and iron, and undoubtedly
oil in abundance in the broken world about it. The
place was “flat” now as a reaction from its original
boom, but it was moving steadily if slowly, and the
right men were drifting in with a view to exploring
its resources.</p>

<p>Very quietly and unostentatiously he was acquiring
every property that fell into the market so long as the
price met his ideas of investment. He was ready to
mortgage for any town property. Smiling at all times,
his purse was always open for any proprietor of a
town lot who needed temporary assistance. The man
was a merciless money-spinner of the worst type. Disaster
and misfortune to others were the conditions
under which his real business prospered.</p>

<p>He laid the documents aside and lit a fresh cigarette
from the remains of the other, which he dropped
thoughtfully into the silver-mounted ash-tray on the
desk beside him. Then he sat back in his chair, and,
with his fleshy hands clasped over his ample stomach,
gave himself up to a few moments of rapid mental
calculation.</p>

<p>But his efforts were broken in upon. There was a
light tap on the opaque glass of the door that shut him
off from the outer office, and a clerk pushed his way
in.</p>

<p>In an instant his smiling habit returned, but his tone
of greeting was sharp.</p>

<p>“What in hell is it this time, Jake?” he demanded,
while his hands fell away from his stomach.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span></p>

<p>Jake Forner was a mild-looking creature whose face
gave no true indication of the man behind it. He was
broad and angular, with shoulders that looked sizes
too big for the rest of his body. He was clean-shaven,
with the wide brow and big dark eyes of the student.
But his mouth and jaws were firmly set and suggested
possibilities.</p>

<p>“It’s an open letter,” he said, “and it was handed in
by a kid I just didn’t seem to rec’nise. I didn’t feel
like worrying you with it till I opened it, then I guessed
I’d best pass it in to you right away.”</p>

<p>He came over to the desk and held out an open
sheet of paper, while his dark eyes closely scrutinised
the smiling features of his employer.</p>

<p>Booker took the paper without interest for all the
other’s quietly impressive manner. He glanced at the
open sheet casually, and, in a moment, his attention became
profoundly absorbed.</p>

<p>Jake Forner was watching him. His eyes had something
in them that suggested smiling thought behind
them. He was noting his employer’s expression and
saw it change rapidly from its habitual smile to complete
seriousness, and, finally, to something that seemed
to suggest anger not undriven by alarm.</p>

<p>It was a curious document, littered with a scrawling
writing made up of rough block capital letters and evidently
indited by some rough instrument, possibly a
piece of sharpened wood. The lettering was red and
at the bottom of it, underneath the signature, was the
rough outline of a skull and crossbones, a flamboyant,
melodramatic finish that might well have inspired derision.
But somehow, the thing inspired nothing of
the sort in the mind of the man to whom it was addressed.
He read it carefully:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span></p>

<p class="noindent">

<span class="smcap">Bad Booker</span>,<br />
</p>

<p class="noindent">You are trying to steal a city block from a helpless client.
You have a mortgage on it for two thousand dollars. You
are offering two thousand dollars more to wipe out the mortgage
and possess the lot. The lowest market value of the
property is ten thousand dollars. You will pay the difference
between your mortgage and ten thousand dollars, namely,
eight thousand dollars for the site. You have twenty-four
hours in which to make a written offer of this amount. If
you fail to do this, and to complete the deal in one week from
this date, you will be hanged on the site in question.</p>

</p></div>

<p>Booker did not look up as he finished the reading.
He sat gazing at the paper, and once or twice Jake
Forner observed that he swallowed drily. Then, as
the man remained furiously silent, the clerk cleared his
throat.</p>

<p>“That’s about as ugly as I’ve known ’em to play,”
he said in a tone of mild sympathy.</p>

<p>Booker laid the paper down and raised a pair of
angry eyes. The clerk saw the storm in them and
waited for it to break. It came on the instant.</p>

<p>“The swines!” Booker’s body was squared in the
well-padded chair. He was sitting up and breathing
heavily. “The dirty, low-down swines!” he cried.
Then a heavy fist was raised and fell with a crash on
the ill-drawn sign of the skull. “If they think they
can scare me with a bluff like that I reckon they’re
crazy. It’s a hold-up, and I’m falling for no hold-up.
By God! I’ll fight them! Eight thousand? Not on
your life. I’ll press that two thousand home right
away and show ’em they can’t throw a bluff at me and
get away with it. They want a written offer. Well,
I guess they’ll get it. I’ll write it now an’ you can beat
it out to the Carver woman, and put it right into her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
hands. But it’s for two thousand dollars. And I
guess she’ll fall for it quick or&mdash;starve.”</p>

<p>He pushed the Aurora Clan’s document roughly
aside and started to write out his offer, but Jake anxiously
intervened; he quickly raised a white hand and
passed it across his broad forehead.</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t act in a hurry,” he said quickly. “You’re
bucking a tough game with the ‘aces’ against you. The
Aurora bunch have been mighty busy in the past weeks.
Is it worth it? Just look back an’ see. Bernard’s
gone. Clean wiped out, an’ he’s had to beat it out of
Beacon looking like a black rooster that hasn’t moulted
right. Then there was Pat Herne who robbed Len
Sitwell when he was soused at the Speedway. They
hanged him right outside the town limits. Then don’t
forget Dick Mansell, who held up the stage coming
in from Ranger. He was left pumped full of lead till
you couldn’t tell his guts from an ash riddle. I’m
scared for you, boss. I surely am. Ther’s a terror
creepin’ through this place scares me plumb to death.
These guys are a citizen bunch and no sort of ordinary
toughs. They’re acting seemingly with some sort of
slab-sided purpose. They’re wise to every move going
on, an’ I can’t reckon how they get hold of things.
But there it is, and when they hand in a brief on a
boy they put through the thing it says. We’re a business
enterprise, boss, and it’s our job to beat the other
feller if we can. But I sort of feel when ther’s a
hanging bee at the end of it, business goes right out.
Don’t you jump, boss. Sure I’m scared. I haven’t
your nerve. But I got it right here,” and he tapped his
forehead with a forefinger, “this is no sort of bluff.
It’s dead straight. An’ I’m not yearning to see you
swinging on the wrong end of a rawhide rope.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span></p>

<p>Jake spoke quietly but urgently, and his usually mild
eyes were a match for his manner. He was Booker’s
confidential clerk, a man of quiet efficiency and whose
vision was unusually clear. So, for all his swift wrath,
Booker had let him talk. Now, however, the usurer
leapt uppermost and his reply was swift and biting.</p>

<p>“You want me to hand out eight thousand at the
orders of this gang?” he cried, furiously. “You want
me to pass eight thousand good dollars to Rebecca
Carver when she’s ready to close for two? You’re
crazy, Jake! Crazy as a bed-bug! If that’s the sort
of business we’re to do, I guess the sooner we close
our doors and beat it the better. Besides&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“And the hanging bee?”</p>

<p>The eyes of the clerk were steadily regarding his
furious chief, and somehow the quiet reminder was not
without effect. Booker shifted his gaze and it fell on
the lamentable design of the skull.</p>

<p>“This thing sets me crazy mad,” he protested, and
his tone had somehow fallen from its original bluster.</p>

<p>“But you’ll be madder&mdash;for a while&mdash;at the hanging
bee.”</p>

<p>Booker broke into a short, harsh laugh at his clerk’s
persistence in dwelling upon the thing he saw lying
ahead.</p>

<p>“That stunt has got you scared all right, Jake,”
Booker said, with a world of contempt in the quick
look he raised to the man’s pale face. “Maybe you’re
guessing, seeing you’re my clerk, they’ll need you to
be present to share in the game.”</p>

<p>A flush mounted to the clerk’s cheeks.</p>

<p>“You can guess that way if you fancy, boss,” he
retorted, in a pronounced change of tone. Then his
eyes searched the fat, unsmiling face before him. “But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
you best get this right now and get it quick. I’m out
for your profit as well as my own. I’m out to see this
business go right on without any interruption in the
nature of a hanging bee. If you collected that chunk
of real estate for two thousand dollars on top of the
mortgage it would be a swell profit. Some folks might
call it robbery, seeing they ain’t in it. But ten thousand
dollars is bedrock just now as they say in that
brief, and, when boom time comes again, you won’t
miss the six thousand dollars’ difference they’re demanding.
Well, I guess I’d buy off a hanging bee,
with me as the centrepiece, any old time for six thousand
dollars. And if you’re wise, I guess you’ll act
that way, too.”</p>

<p>“But you’re forgetting the bluff of it all,” Booker
said, without looking up. Then he raised his hard
eyes. “Gee, haven’t you any sort of old guts makes
you want to kick? Can you stand for a thing like
that?” he cried, holding up the ill-written document.
“Are we men, or&mdash;&mdash;?”</p>

<p>“We certainly wouldn’t be men for long if we didn’t
stand for it. You don’t seem to get a grip of this
thing, boss. I’ve watched it all the time. This Aurora
bunch is as real as the old Ku-Klux Klan, that cleaned
up the south in the nigger days. You’re wondering if
we’re men. Well, I’d say right here, let’s be. Don’t
write your offer in a hurry. Think awhile. An’ when
you’ve thought good I’ll saddle my pony and ride out
to Rebecca Carver with the result. It won’t hurt us
to get that block at the price they say. But it will at
any other. I’m making that tracing of the new city
limits and need to get right on with it. Maybe in a
while you’ll let me know the thing you’ve decided.”</p>

<p>Jake turned away and passed quickly into the outer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
office, closing the partition door carefully behind him.
Booker watched him go with eyes which had doubt in
them for the first time. Yielding was utterly foreign
to his nature where advantage in a transaction lay
within his grasp. But the mild-eyed clerk had driven
home his argument in a fashion all the more relentless
for its sobriety. And for once in his life Bad Booker,
the usurer, was thinking more of the vision of a hanging
as conjured by his subordinate than he was of robbing
a helpless widow of six thousand dollars.</p>

<span class="fs95">The Great Disaster</span></h2>


<p class="drop-capy1">THE mother was sitting over her cookstove. She
was almost crouching over it. With her hands
tightly clasped she seemed as though she was striving
with every resource of her being to support herself under
the crushing weight of the great grief with which
she was beset. Her widely gazing eyes were straining
with the mental anguish behind them. And they were
utterly unseeing for all they stared into the ruddy heart
of the fire shining between the upright bars. Stony
misery looked out of them, that dreadful expression
of heartbreak which seems to leave a woman powerless,
helpless.</p>

<p>The living room about her was neat, and of its usual
orderliness. It lacked nothing of the housewifely care
that was usually bestowed upon it. For all the poverty
of its furnishing, it was a place of comfort, which,
even under Rebecca Carver’s suddenly imposed grief,
had not been allowed to suffer. Her daughter Claire
had seen to that. For the time her mother was submerged
in her trouble, and the girl herself was no less
stricken, but will and youth in the latter had overridden
every weakness of the moment.</p>

<p>Thus the mother had sat for many hours. And the
transformation which had taken place in her in twenty-four
hours was something almost horrifying to the devoted
daughter.</p>

<p>During the long hours of night the still, silent figure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
had nursed her despair. Claire, no less sleepless, had
discovered her in precisely the same position each time
she had left her bed in an adjoining room. She had
prayed her mother, she had sought to persuade her by
every means in her power, to seek her bed, and such
peace as sleep might afford her. But it had all been
useless. Each time her mother had obeyed her submissively,
meekly, almost mechanically, only to return
again to her vigil at the fireside the moment she had
been left alone.</p>

<p>The grey afternoon was far advanced when Claire
returned from the creek below with her arms full of
a snowy laundry. Work! It had been the same all
day with her. It was her only defence. She pushed
her way in through the half-open door, and one swift
glance and the sound of rustling paper as she deposited
her burden on the well-worn table, told her of the
unchanged mental attitude of her mother.</p>

<p>Just for a moment she stood regarding the bowed
figure with troubled eye. She saw the crumpled news-sheet,
one of the papers which Ivor had left with them
the day before. It was crushed under her arms as
they rested in her lap. And she understood. Her
mother had been reading again, perhaps for the hundredth
time, that brief newspaper story which was the
source of the nightmare of disaster which had fallen
upon them.</p>

<p>The girl was tired and utterly dispirited. Somehow
her tall, graceful figure seemed slightly bowed out of
its usual courageous bearing. Her pretty eyes were
ringed about, as though, in the absence of observation,
she had yielded to her woman’s expression of grief.
But now, at the sight of the silent, tearless figure at
the stove, she summoned every ounce of her youthful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
courage to her aid. She moved across the room
quickly, and deliberately removed the paper from beneath
the yielding arms.</p>

<p>“Must you, mother?” she said quietly, but with a
sharpness she was wholly unaware of. Then she added
as she smoothed out the paper, “Will it do any good?
You’ve read the story till&mdash;till you’re nigh sick.
You’ve read it till I just can’t bear seeing you read it
any longer. I guess I’ll need to burn it if I don’t want
to have you set crazy.”</p>

<p>But she made no attempt to burn the paper, and all
her courage seemed to fade completely out as her
mother raised to hers a pair of eyes that were filled
with a world of piteousness.</p>

<p>The latter shook her greying head.</p>

<p>“I won’t go crazy, child,” she said in a low,
monotonous voice. “Give me time, dear. You see,
he was my boy&mdash;my Jim. He was everything to me&mdash;my
son, and&mdash;and he’s gone.”</p>

<p>Something stirred in the girl&mdash;something suddenly
spurred her. It was an expression of youthful hope,
which, in calmer moments, she would have realised was
ill-enough founded.</p>

<p>“But has he?” she demanded, almost vehemently.
“You don’t know&mdash;we don’t know! You’ve read that
story till you can’t read it right. Our judgment’s been
snowed under in the scare of it. That’s so, sure!
What is it? Why, it’s just a news story,” she cried,
flinging scornful emphasis into her tone. “It’s a fool
news story they love to scare folks with, an’ later
they’ll contradict it without pity for the worry and
grief it’s caused to the folks who’ve read it. I’ve
thought and thought and I tell you it’s&mdash;it’s not real.
I don’t believe he’s dead. Here, I’ll show you. I’ll<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
read it. You sit there and just listen. Will you?
Then you’ll see.”</p>

<p>She smoothed the paper again and moved away to
the open doorway. Then she read in a strident voice
and commented as she read:</p>

<p class="p1">“‘Disaster at Sea? Urgent SOS.’</p>

<p class="p1">“That’s the headline, mum dear, and there’s a question
marked against it,” she cried. “You get that? Even
the paper asks the question.”</p>

<p>The girl had looked up. She was urgently regarding
the figure at the stove. She was seeking a sign and
seemed to find it in the fact that her mother had sat up.</p>

<p>“Listen,” she went on quickly. “You need to get the
words just as they are.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“‘The S. S. <i>Arbuthnot</i> of Liverpool, bound for Sydney,
N.S.W., picked up the following wireless on the morning of
27th inst.: “Sailing-ship <i>Imperial</i>, Bristol. Steering gear
carried away. Cargo shifted. Plates badly sprung. Sinking.
Send help. Possibly last twenty-four hours.”’”</p></div>

<p>Again the girl looked up.</p>

<p>“Then there’s figgers I don’t understand,” she said.
“Maybe they’re her position. But you see she’s going
to last twenty-four hours. Anything, I guess, could
happen in that time. There’s the boats. Maybe if
there’s storm, it’ll let up. We’ve seen it storm nigh a
hurricane on the sea back of here and flatten out in
twelve hours&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>The mother shook her head despairingly. “I’ve
thought all that,” she said, in a low voice. Then she
seemed to pull herself together for a supreme effort.
“It’s kind of you, Claire, to&mdash;to&mdash;say all this. I know,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
my dear. You’re feeling just as badly, and you’re trying
to help us both. But I feel it right here,” she went
on, clasping her bosom with both hands. “He’s gone&mdash;our
Jim. It just wasn’t meant for him to get back
with&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“That’s fool talk, mother, and I won’t listen,” Claire
broke in roughly. “You’ve thought yourself into that.
But there’s the rest.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“‘The <i>Arbuthnot</i>, steamed at once to the rescue. She arrived
on the scene at the position indicated, and, though the
weather had improved, no trace of the <i>Imperial</i> was discovered.’</p></div>

<p>“You see, mum? The weather had improved.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“‘Similarly, the <i>Argonaut</i>, bound from Shanghai to New
Zealand, picked up the <i>Imperial’s</i> message and hurried to the
rescue. She apparently arrived at the given position some
hours later. She reports no better success. There was no
trace of the distressed vessel, and it is presumed she must
have foundered. The best hope lies in the fact that, with
the storm abating and twenty-four hours’ grace, the crew
of the foundering vessel was able to get away in the boats,
although as yet none of these are reported having been picked
up.</p>

<p>“‘The <i>Imperial</i> of Bristol is a full-rigged ship of three
thousand tons engaged in a West Australian coasting trade.
She carried a crew of eighteen or twenty.’</p></div>

<p>“No, no, mum, dear,” Claire cried, forcing a smile
to her tired eyes. “We mustn’t lose hope. We surely
mustn’t. Why, even the paper reckons the crew must
have got away. Just think. Twenty-four hours and
the storm quitting. You know Jim. I reckon he isn’t
the boy to lie around waiting to drown. I’d bet our last
cent they got the boats out, and&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span></p>

<p>“What then, Claire?” cried the mother, in a sudden
passionate outburst. “I’ve looked up those figgers on
the map. That boat, with our Jim on it, was right out
in mid-ocean, thousands of miles from land. Think
of it, girl, and don’t talk foolish. Mid-ocean! Open
boats that couldn’t stand half a gale! And they’re not
reported picked up. I tell you&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>But the girl had turned to the doorway. A horse-man
had just ridden up and flung out of the saddle.
It was Jake Forner, Bad Booker’s clerk, and he came
straight to the doorway where Claire was standing.</p>

<p>It was a moment of complete reaction. The sight of
the broad shoulders of the real estate man’s clerk,
with his dark, mild eyes and mild, almost gentle manner,
did that for the troubled women which no effort
of their own could have achieved. The pressure of
despairing thought was flung into the background in
face of the urgency of the thing which this man’s arrival
heralded. Even, perhaps, because of the enormity
of the trouble which had befallen, this man’s coming
was of greater significance.</p>

<p>The mother remained unmoving. But Claire bravely
faced the newcomer with a smile that had no inspiration
from any pleasurable emotion.</p>

<p>“How do, Mr. Forner,” she said, with a cheerfulness
that had seemed impossible seconds ago. “Guess
you’ve come along for my mother’s answer? Will you
come right in?”</p>

<p>Then she turned swiftly to the woman at the stove.
She moved over to her and stood close beside her as
though to protect her as the man obeyed her invitation.</p>

<p>“I’m kind of sorry, dear,” she said quickly. “I
didn’t tell you about it before because&mdash;because&mdash;Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
Booker offered you two thousand dollars for that city
block he has a mortgage on. Guess Mr. Forner has
ridden out for his answer.”</p>

<p>Then she looked straight into the man’s dark eyes
while she went on speaking to her mother.</p>

<p>“It’s a real tough proposition,” she said slowly, and
with all the biting emphasis she could fling into the
words. “It’s so tough I feel like telling Booker the
things a girl ’ud hate to say. The block is worth ten
thousand dollars on the market to-day, which means
eight thousand dollars to him, and he wants to hand
you two thousand dollars for it. Are you going to take
the money or starve&mdash;which is Booker’s pleasant alternative?
I guess we need to decide right away.”</p>

<p>“Ther’s no need for a decision on those figgers, Miss
Claire,” Jake said quickly, his usually impassive face
flushing under the sting of this beautiful girl’s words.</p>

<p>“How d’you mean?”</p>

<p>Claire’s demand came sharply. It came in that startled
fashion which suggested apprehension lest Booker
had withdrawn even his usurious offer.</p>

<p>Jake’s flush had faded out. He stood just within
the doorway, a curiously ungainly figure in his simple
city tweed suit which seemed to belong to another
world than that of this primitive log home built by
folks who had lived their lives in the golden wilderness
of the North. His fine eyes were smiling kindly in
the manner of one who feels himself to be something
in the nature of a ministering, beneficent angel rather
than the executioner of the will of an unscrupulous
usurer.</p>

<p>“Why, he’s reconsidered his proposal,” he said
quietly, his smile communicating itself to the rest of
his face. “I guess he’s sounded the market and feels<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
he wants to treat you right. Maybe he didn’t just
remember the exact position of that swell corner block
when he made his offer to you yesterday. He knows
about it now,” he went on drily, “and fancies handing
you eight thousand dollars for complete reversion. I
kind of think that’s a square deal, Mrs. Carver. Here’s
his ‘brief’ to that effect and the cash, in dollars, is enclosed.
You’ll just need to sign the deed I’ll hand you
as a preliminary, and the transfer can go through next
time you’re along in town. Do you feel like closing?”</p>

<p>There was much more in the man’s simply spoken
statement than he realised. There was much more,
too, in his manner, and somehow the unexpectedness
of Booker’s change of attitude held Claire silent while
she regarded the smiling face of the man who brought
the pleasant news.</p>

<p>Rebecca Carver’s interest, however, had fallen back
before the mother grief which had only been deposed
from its supremacy for a few moments. She made no
attempt to reply in any form, while her gaze was
turned once more to her stove.</p>

<p>Claire suddenly urged her.</p>

<p>“You’ll accept, mother?” she said quickly, and the
other nodded.</p>

<p>Then the girl turned again to the waiting man who
had withdrawn a letter and the document that must be
signed, from an inner pocket.</p>

<p>Claire forced a laugh to her lips.</p>

<p>“It seems queer, Mr. Forner,” she said shrewdly.
“Yes, surely we’ll accept, and mother’ll sign. But I’m
kind of glad you came, and I’m real glad to hear you
say that piece, especially seeing Booker and I discussed
the market value of the block and he was fully aware of
its position. I’d made a guess you’ve somehow had a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
deal to do with changing his mind. It isn’t easy for
a decent man to sit around while his boss is trying to
rob a helpless woman. I’ll just get a pen&mdash;oh, you’ve
a fountain pen. Well, mother’ll sign right away, and
our blessing’ll surely follow you on your way right
back to the city.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Jake Forner had departed and his coming had done
more for the two bereft women than either of them
was aware of. The paralysing effect of the newspaper
story had given place to the reality of things.
Grief was still driving them hard, but its pressure had
somehow become less devastating, less numbing&mdash;more
particularly was this the case with Claire.</p>

<p>She was still standing in the open doorway gazing
out into the grey light of the dying fall day whence
she had passed her “God-speed” to the man who had
executed his mission with so much obvious goodwill
and pleasure.</p>

<p>Had the girl possessed half the woman’s vanity to
which she was entitled, she might have understood
something of the ungainly man’s feelings in visiting
her home. But Claire had not as yet discovered in
herself that dormant self-appreciation which is so essentially
an expression of all human nature. She had
learned little or nothing from the faithful, if inadequate,
mirror in her small lean-to sleeping quarters.
Her wide blue eyes were simply a feature with which
to witness the wonders of the world about her, just as
her mass of ruddy hair was a something to brush
laboriously and to fret over. Her slim, girlish figure
she had only learned to deplore in the arduous labours
which her life entailed, and its effect upon the men
with whom she came into contact concerned her not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
at all. As yet her woman’s charm was a negative
factor in her life.</p>

<p>But she was thinking hard as she gazed out upon
the grey and russet of the fall world about her. Her
gaze was upon the familiar, wood-clad slopes beyond
the creek, on which was situated their spent gold claim.
The slowly meandering waters that murmured their
ceaseless song on the still air helped to impress the
loneliness that for the first time in her life had suddenly
made itself felt. And somehow, it set up an
almost irresistible longing to flee from the sound of it.</p>

<p>For all her brave effort to help her mother she knew
her beloved brother had been completely swept out of
their lives. The hungry, merciless waters had swallowed
him up. She would never, never, never see him
again, or listen to his quiet, confident words. Never
again would she witness those unobtrusive little acts
of devotion which had been so unfailing in their home
life with him. No, he was gone out of their lives
completely, utterly. It was the end of a long chapter
of youthful dreaming. And ahead lay an impenetrable
future in which care and responsibility must be shouldered,
and hers must be the burden of it.</p>

<p>For a moment something like panic surged in her
heart. Before, only grief had stirred her. But, of a
sudden now, grief receded into the background, a depressing
shadow always threatening, whilst a wholly
new emotion took possession of her. Her moment of
panic passed. Her thought cleared of all confusion
and a swift, keen resolution descended upon her and
brought her calmness of spirit.</p>

<p>Claire had far more in common with her dead father
than with the gentle woman behind her. In looks,
in build, in spirit she was essentially her father’s child.
Never before had the dead man’s qualities had reason<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
to display themselves in her. But now it was different.
In her realisation of her sudden responsibilities, the
flood-tide of the reckless gambling spirit of her parent
poured forth. Her brother Jim, in the same spirit, had
fared forth to the uttermost ends of the earth on a
bare&mdash;almost ridiculous&mdash;chance to help them in their
need. He had achieved. And only the merciless waves
had robbed him and them of the full fruits of his gambler’s
adventure. Could she sit down under the misfortune
that had robbed them of a well-loved brother
and the fortune he had won for them? No. For all
the fall day was closing, with their fortunes at a lesser
ebb than the dawn had found them, their need was still
urgent. And the spirit of her father was awake and
burning strongly in her as she contemplated its reality.</p>

<p>She turned abruptly into the darkening room. Her
gaze took in the figure of her mother still bowed under
her load of grief. Then it passed to the thick packet
of notes lying where she had left them on the table.
They represented the limits of their worldly fortune.
They were all that stood between them and the starvation
Booker had originally designed for them. Her
eyes lit, and her spirit suddenly buoyed.</p>

<p>But she turned away and passed quickly into the
lean-to sleeping room that was hers. What was her
purpose was of little concern. Her woman’s mind was
working swiftly, almost feverishly. She stood for a
while contemplating the trifling wardrobe of gowns
hanging under a cotton curtain. She examined each
garment quickly, urgently. Then, with a gesture that
was half impatient, she permitted the curtain to fall
back over them and she moved across to the small
mirror before which she was accustomed to brush her
hair.</p>

<p>Here she stood for a while studying the features it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
reflected. The message it passed her was for her ears
alone. Maybe it told her some of those things which
everybody but she was fully aware of. Maybe she
only obtained a measure of reassurance. Whatever
happened in those long, silent moments she turned away
at last, and something seemed to have transformed
her. Her eyes were alight. Her shapely lips were
firmly set, and she passed into the living-room beyond.
Her whole manner was that of one whose mind is
irrevocably made up.</p>

<p>She came to her mother’s side and laid a gentle hand
on her bowed shoulder.</p>

<p>“Mum, dear,” she said deliberately, “we’re going to
move right into Beacon. It’ll set you crazy and me
too, to stop around out here. There’s things this place
won’t ever let us forget, an’ we’ve got to forget.
Maybe we’re mostly feeling dead now. That’s the
way grief hits us. But we’re both alive and need to
go right on living. If Jim was here he’d decide for us
the thing we need to do. He isn’t. So&mdash;so I’ve got
to think for us both and push it through. We got
eight thousand dollars to feed, an’ clothe, an’ shelter
us. Maybe it would do for a while. But after&mdash;what
then?”</p>

<p>The mother looked up. It was the questioning of
one incapable of anything else.</p>

<p>“What do you mean, Claire? What’re you going to
do?”</p>

<p>There was no inspiration, there was even no interest
in the questions.</p>

<p>“Do? Do?” Claire’s reiteration was thrilling with
live purpose and something like leaping excitement.
“Do? Why, do as father would have done. Do as he
did time and again.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span></p>

<p>Her strong young fingers unconsciously gripped the
soft flesh of her mother’s shoulders. Suddenly she
dropped on her knees beside the other’s chair, while
she took possession of the work-worn hands lying in
the lap before her. She raised them both to her young
lips and covered them with warm kisses of real devotion.
Then she held them tightly.</p>

<p>“Mum, dear, we haven’t a thing but that eight thousand.
Not a thing but that. But there’s money&mdash;money
in plenty in Beacon at the Speedway. Father
always reckoned so when things were bad. And he
most always found it. I’m going to find it, too, all
we want. You know what father used to say. He
taught Jim and me the poker game he played, and he
taught us good. And in the end, do you mind how I
took his, and Jim’s, spare cash when they had it? Do
you? I do. And do you remember the thing father
always said? He said I’d the poker face, and the poker
head, and the only luck in the world he was scared to
buck. It’s that luck we’re going to buck, dear. We’re
going right into Beacon with our dollars. And I’m
going to buck the game for all that’s in me. Ther’s
not a thing else for us. True, ther’ isn’t. Jim’s gone.
Our Jim! You know it. And, for all I’ve said, I know
it, too. We’ve no one but ourselves and my luck to
save us from starving in a fierce, relentless world.
Are you game, dear? I may do it? Sure I may. I
can see it in your poor, sad, tired eyes. Yes. It’s
that, sure, dear, and you can trust me.”</p>

<p>The girl reached up suddenly. It was a moment of
supreme emotion. She yielded to it. She caught and
held her mother’s body in her strong young arms.
And then came the flood of tears for the grief that
weighed so heavily on both their devoted hearts.</p>

<span class="fs95">Eight Months Later&mdash;On the Lias River</span></h2>


<p class="drop-capy1">THE dark shadows of winter had long since passed
away from the Alaskan world. The almost interminable
nights, the pitifully brief days of storm, of
cold, the drear that literally eats into the heart and
bones of man, these were left a hazy memory to be
quickly forgotten, lost in the new season of hope which
comes with a generous rush. It was a world released
from months of cruel imprisonment.</p>

<p>Just inland from the mouth of the Lias River, where
the broad bosom of its stream was lightly stirred by the
gentlest of warming spring breezes, a man was at work
stowing his stout-built canoe with its cargo of camp
outfit. The vessel was moored against a shelving of
granite rock. A stout rawhide held it secure to a
boulder of ponderous dimensions, for it was a barren,
rocky shore without vegetation of any sort.</p>

<p>It was a fierce coast line, harsh, unyielding and
honeycombed with every trap for destruction that the
wit of Nature could conceive. Shoals and sunken
rocks littered every inlet, and fierce, sweeping currents
and cross-currents made the smiling waters a nightmare
of chaos. Then, behind everything, lay those
merciless reserve forces of sudden wind squalls which
howled down the mountain slopes without warning, or
reason, and blasted the coast line into a churning of
fierce tempest.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span></p>

<p>Pitiless in its treachery, this long, tattered coast line
was for the most part completely shunned by man.
Yet here, well within the mouth of the Lias River, a
white man was labouring at his craft, indifferent to
the terror of his surroundings.</p>

<p>The man was sturdily built. He was broad and
stocky and stood something less than six feet in
height. For all the warming of the clear, spring day
he was clad in the thick clothing with which the men
of the North are loth to part until the summer heat
makes it intolerable. He was a man of something
over thirty, with a strong face that was clean-shaven,
or was supposed to be, and with a pair of such pale
blue eyes as to be devoid of all expression. They
were curious eyes, curious in that they revealed not a
glimmer of the mind behind them, curious in that
their stony expression was unchanging under any and
every emotion.</p>

<p>His boat was moored securely, for the tide was
a-surge and running out to sea. An iron bar, jammed
in a crevice in the shelving granite, afforded him his
second mooring and left him free to pursue his labours
at leisure.</p>

<p>Behind him gaped a rift in the granite wall which
rose to a height of several hundred feet. It was obviously
the night shelter in which his camp had been
made, for, immediately before the entrance, the remains
of his fire were still smouldering. Maybe, the
narrow opening was the entrance to a cavern that
widened and heightened, for just such caverns, of every
size and shape, abounded in these iron walls.</p>

<p>He worked on till the last of his outfit was securely
stowed and the canoe lay deep in the water. Then he
passed back to his camp-fire. For a second or two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
he glanced about him questioningly, then with the aid
of a slab of stone he picked up the hot ashes and proceeded
to dump them into the river. The final clearing
was done with infinite care and patience, and even
he resorted to the brushing away of the last signs of
his fire with a sweeper made of a tied bundle of brushwood.</p>

<p>It was all a little curious. It was all rather furtive.
It seemed so unnecessary in this wilderness of a no-man’s-land.
Yet the man paid heed to the obliteration
of all signs of his encampment with as much care as
though his very life depended upon the complete covering
of his tracks. Finally, the brushwood bundle was
added to the burden of his canoe and he cast off his
moorings. Then, in a moment, he took his place amidships
and thrust off with the blade of his double
paddle.</p>

<p>The little vessel shot out into the tide with a velocity
that was almost threatening. But the man was ready
and skilful and its nose swung round under the pressure
of the dipping paddle and headed across current
making tremendous leeway. Slowly, however, the
guiding hand made itself felt, and the bow of the craft
headed up into the stream. Later he would have the
flood tide to help him, but for a while he must battle
with a head stream. That was all right. That was
calculated. It was his urgent desire to escape the
chances of these dreaded wind squalls which might
descend at any moment.</p>

<p>He laboured steadily, creeping up the hither shore
to avoid the full race of the tide. He hugged the
granite walls of the canyon through which the river
cut its way to the ocean. The swirling waters revealed
the presence of a chain of sunken rocks through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
which he was threading his way, and only skill and
keenness of vision could hope to save him from sheer
disaster. But he pursued his course without hesitation,
without a moment of shaken confidence, often
dallying with death by a margin of less than inches.
And so it went on for nearly an hour.</p>

<p>At the end of that time the change he had awaited
took place. The pace of his progress materially increased.
The head pressure lessened. It was then for
the first time he permitted himself a glance up at the
smiling sky in the direction of the distant hills towards
which he was heading.</p>

<p>A sigh of satisfaction escaped him. The sign of
clemency he was seeking was there in the perfect
cloudlessness. The whole breadth of the sky was a
brilliant azure. And, furthermore, the critical moment
of slack water had arrived. Now he knew that the
hill squalls intended to remain quiescent, and he swung
his craft clear of the frowning granite cliffs for the
deep waters.</p>

<p>The man’s pale eyes were no longer watchful.
There was no longer any need. With a great depth
of water under his canoe he could drive her leisurely,
awaiting the coming flood from the ocean far behind.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Cy Liskard was lounging in the doorway of his
cabin. He was smoking contemplatively while his pale
eyes gazed out over the gravelly, trickling creek below
him. Near by, secured to a tying post, which was the
stump of a sapling spruce, two Alaskan ponies were
waiting ready for the long trail into Beacon Glory.
One was saddled and bridled, the other was carrying a
well-laden pack. Both were sturdy, powerful creatures
still clad in their long winter coats.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span></p>

<p>It was a still, warm day, with the air full of the
hum of the insect world. The long tails of the horses
were swishing with flail-like force to keep the attacking
mosquitoes and flies at bay. For the moment the
sun was lost behind frothing summer clouds, while
below, the dense forests were silent and still with that
profound hush which is their prevailing mood.</p>

<p>It was a perfect scene, typical of the greater foothills
where Nature permits nothing human to disturb
her hush. On every hand hills rose to immense
heights, bald of head, but densely clad on their lower
slopes with forests of every shade of green. Soft, and
gracious, and pleasant to gaze upon, the forests were
deep, and dark, and well-nigh illimitable. They were
full of preying animal life, and even in the full of
daylight the howl of coyote and the harsher bay of
prowling timber wolf came echoing down the aisles of
leafless trunks.</p>

<p>But Cy Liskard was all unconcerned for Nature’s
sounds, for Nature’s moods. He was by no means
condemned to a lifelong existence in the world’s dark
places. He was there by selection and of deliberate
purpose, and his purpose appeared fairly obvious. For
there, below him, on the trickling creek, lay the complete,
primitive equipment of the gold-seeker’s craft.</p>

<p>But for all his expressionless gaze was upon these
things his thought was far away, concerned only with
its contemplation of the thing which lay ahead at the
end of the further journey upon which he was about
to embark. As with all the hardy creatures who seek
treasure in the remotenesses of the northern world, the
joy of return to the cities of men was a passionate
yearning that had no limits.</p>

<p>In the two weeks since his return from the mouth of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
the Lias River his preparations had been completed,
and they were more considerable than might have been
supposed to be necessary. This was his home for the
time. This was his hunting ground. It was an uncharted,
unregistered gold prospect, and as such it
was open to invasion or any chance discovery that
might completely rob him of any proprietary rights he
might claim. So his preparations had been made
carefully and in a fashion best calculated to safeguard
his interests.</p>

<p>Now with the last detail worked out to his satisfaction
he had abandoned himself to a contemplation of
the good time which he intended Beacon Glory should
yield him. And for all his pale eyes gave no sign, the
mind behind them was full of smiling anticipation.
He was thinking of the burden of gold on the pack-saddle,
and of the balance of credit at Victor Burns’
bank which he knew to be lying there in his name.
He was thinking of the wine to be bought at Max
Lepende’s “Speedway”; of the orgy he intended to buy
there. He was contemplating the glitter of the place
and the seductive charm of the women with whom he
would dance. Then there was the great game with its
never-failing lure, and the thought of this last was
bound up with the vision of a young girl, beautiful as
a dream, with flaming hair, and eyes whose colour
seemed to change with her every mood, now violet, now
blue, and sometimes almost sea-green. He had only
seen her once, but memory had never let go of the
vision. This time he was determined his memories of
her should be more intimate, whatever the price to be
paid.</p>

<p>He abruptly bestirred himself and a sound escaped
him that was like a laugh. But his harsh face and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
baffling eyes gave no sign. He turned and fastened his
cabin door behind him. Then he moved across to the
ponies patiently awaiting his pleasure.</p>

<p>He passed round them quickly, feeling the cinche
of both. The pack was secure, but his own saddle required
tightening up. He raised the legadero of the
saddle and pulled mercilessly on the knotted strap.
Then he kicked the grass-fed belly of the docile creature
to make the tightening closer. Finally, he dropped
the legadero to its full length and prepared to mount.</p>

<p>As he did so a blaze of sun shone out from behind
the summer cloud-bank and the man looked up with
something like a start. For a second he gazed without
blinking and his brows depressed as though the sight
of the sun offended him. Then he glanced away, and
followed its beam where it threw his own shadow absurdly
fore-shortened on the ground. In a moment he
had raised his foot to the stirrup and swung himself
clumsily into the saddle, and, snatching up the rawhide
quirt hanging on the horn in front of him, he
slashed viciously and needlessly at both horses.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The Occidental Exchange was empty of all customers.
It was in the middle of the afternoon and the
time just before the mild rush which usually came
about closing-time. The place was a relic of the earliest
days of Beacon Glory, and, unlike most institutions
of its kind, it had remained un-rebuilt as the city
grew. But the fact was, Victor Burns had realised the
unstable qualities of the first boom, and been content
to await developments. So the place, although
substantial enough, was small and of no visible consequence
for all it was the city’s principal banking
house.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span></p>

<p>Burns was at the counter, which completely cut off all
approach to the premises behind. It was well-gridded
with substantial iron of a mesh that would have puzzled
any gun-man to negotiate. It was a grid which
had been designed out of wide experience, for bank
hold-ups had been a somewhat favoured pastime in the
city’s history.</p>

<p>The banker was talking to his principal teller, a man
who looked almost too young for his position, but
what he lacked in years he made up in physique. He
was a youthful athlete, virile and smilingly self-confident.</p>

<p>“What’s she paid in this morning?” he asked, in the
quiet fashion of simple business interest.</p>

<p>The youth smiled.</p>

<p>“Why, a mere two thousand dollars,” he said with a
shrug.</p>

<p>“Kind of a quiet night, I guess,” Burns returned,
without any responsive smile. Then he folded his
arms on the counter, gazing out of the half-open door,
which was held back by a chain that could be released
from behind the counter. “It’s queer,” he said. “That
girl hadn’t more than two red cents back of last fall.
And now&mdash;why, now she can handle more stuff than
I’ve collected in twenty years. And she handles it
right, too, that kid. They reckon she’s collected all
the luck in Beacon. Well, I’d say she’s collected most
of the business brains with it.” He laughed. “And
she’s still buying city blocks.”</p>

<p>“And swell gowns,” added the teller with a grin.</p>

<p>“Well, I’d say she wouldn’t be the dandy girl she is
if she didn’t. Say&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Burns broke off. A pair of rough ponies had come<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
to a halt outside. They were in full view through the
open doorway.</p>

<p>“Cy Liskard,” he went on after a moment, as he
beheld a man fling out of the saddle. Then he nodded
at the gold scales. “Guess we’ll need them, sure. He’s
a big gold winner.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>To a practical student of human nature like Victor
Burns, Cy Liskard was of more than common interest.
He had come into contact with him in business, and in
business only. But, in consequence, he saw the man
in his most interesting aspect. For, in his understanding,
a man’s business was the best channel through
which to discover the real depth of his character.</p>

<p>He had come to know him as one of the many individual
gold men of the remoter places which radiated
about Beacon. The first time he had encountered the
man was just after winter had closed down, when he
drove into Beacon with a curious, mongrel team of
three utterly inadequate dogs, hauling a home-made
sled which bore a goodly burden of raw gold dust
of excellent quality. He had come straight to the bank
and weighed in his treasure. The transaction had been
made with the customary simple formalities, and the
man’s credit had been duly opened. At that time Cy
had only revealed himself to the banker as a surly,
silent creature who had none of the reckless buoyancy
of the men who usually came in to sell their dust.</p>

<p>He had promised, at that time, a further consignment
later in the winter when travelling was good, if
he were able to purchase a really reliable dog team to
replace the disreputable bunch that had at last succeeded
in bringing him in.</p>

<p>Victor had ventured a little frank talk on receiving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
this opening. He had complimented the man on his
strike, and the quality of his gold and had inquired
if there were other prospectors in his neighbourhood.
It was then he realised something of the man with
whom he was dealing. The baffling eyes were raised
to the banker’s. They looked, or rather stared, coldly
and hardly into his, while he negatively shook his head.</p>

<p>“Ther’ ain’t a guy around my lay-out but myself&mdash;and
ther’ don’t need to be,” he said with a snap of his
square jaws.</p>

<p>It was the quiet tone of threat in the final words
that enlightened the banker to that which lay behind the
man’s mask-like face, and he had made no further
effort to interest his customer.</p>

<p>Since that visit there had been another about mid-winter.
The man blew into the bank on the swirl of
a blizzard that lasted for three days. At that visit his
credit had been more, much more than trebled. And
now had come a third trip into the city and Burns was
deeply intrigued.</p>

<p>The man thrust his way in through the doorway
bearing two lashed bundles, one under each arm.
They were large and obviously of considerable weight,
and his movements were swift almost to hastiness.</p>

<p>It was to the banker’s thinking an unintentional outward
sign of his relief at the safe completion of his
journey and the final depositing of his treasure.</p>

<p>“Howdo, Mr. Liskard,” he greeted the man, as he
laid his bundles on the edge of the counter. “Make
a good trip in?” Then he smiled on the two bundles.
“You look to be good an’ busy on your patch.” He
turned to the teller, who was looking on interestedly.
“The scales, Rickards.”</p>

<p>“’Tain’t bad on the trail this time o’ year,” Cy admitted,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
with more than usual readiness, as he cut the
lashings of his burden with a vicious-looking sheath-knife.</p>

<p>The banker watching him noted the details of his
powerful body under the thick pea-jacket that was
closely buttoned over it. He watched the rough hands,
with thumbs stumped short in their top joints, and
with the flattest, shortest, ugliest nails he had ever
seen, as he ripped the bonds asunder. Then his gaze
lifted again to the hard face, with its dirty stubble of
beard and whisker, clearly unshaven on his journey,
and his shrewd mind was swiftly estimating. He
reckoned, by the growth of whisker, the man must have
been on the trail at least three weeks, if he had started
clean-shaven.</p>

<p>But the two bundles were open and the canvas bags
tied at their necks were revealed bulging with their
precious contents. In a moment the banker’s interest
became absorbed.</p>

<p>“That all dust?” he asked quickly. Then he added:
“Some stuff there&mdash;sure.”</p>

<p>Cy nodded without speaking. He cut the fastenings
and passed the bags through the grid which Burns had
flung open.</p>

<p>“Weigh it,” he said.</p>

<p>The man’s voice was harsh and his demand sharp,
and the banker passed the bags to the teller at the
scales.</p>

<p>No further word passed while the youth manipulated
the weights, and Cy watched his every movement
with an intensity of concentration that brought his
dark brows closely together over his curious eyes.</p>

<p>The gold was emptied into the scale, which only
took a portion of one bag. The teller noted the weight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
and emptied the scale into one of the bank’s own
leather bags. Six times the scale was filled to overflowing,
while the silent men looked on at the dull,
red-yellow of the gold this man had brought. It was
dust and nuggets, but mostly nuggets of splendid proportions.</p>

<p>Cy Liskard was leaning on the counter with folded
arms, and when the weighing was completed and the
teller bent over his task of working out the sum, he
drew a deep sigh as though in relief that his task had
been completed.</p>

<p>Victor looked up at the sound.</p>

<p>“Kind of makes a boy glad to get it safe into the
bank. In these days of hold-ups around Beacon it’s
jumpy play toting a bunch of dust around. Say, that’s
swell stuff. Good an’ red, like the stuff the boys collected
on ‘Eighty Mile’ years back. I haven’t seen that
colour anywhere around Beacon till you hit along with
your bunch last fall. Are you registered?”</p>

<p>Cy’s gaze was withdrawn from the moving pen of
the teller. “Not on your life.”</p>

<p>Burns raised his eyebrows.</p>

<p>“That’s taking a chance,” he demurred. “Aren’t
you scared folks’ll jump in on you?”</p>

<p>The man made a sound like a laugh. But his face
was unmoving.</p>

<p>“Not a little bit,” he said roughly. “I guess ther’
ain’t a guy in Beacon with the guts to get out to the
creek I got staked. If he’d the guts he couldn’t make
it. An’ if he made it he’d forgit wakin’ when the daylight
come around. No, sir. I ain’t registered, an’
don’t figger to. I ain’t handin’ a map of my strike to
any cursed official. I ain’t handin’ the story to a deaf
mute. I got my patch, an’ I’ll keep it. I nigh sweated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
blood to locate it. Register an’ haf the world would
get right on my back. I’ll take all the chances, an’ God
help the son of a mule who gets within a mile of it.
What’s the tally?”</p>

<p>The teller read out the figures in a tone of wonderment
his youth could not conceal.</p>

<p>“Eighty-two thousand dollars and twenty-five cents,”
he said, and passed the figures to his chief for verification.</p>

<p>Cy nodded, while the banker examined the paper.</p>

<p>“That’s about my reckoning,” he said. “I’ll be
totin’ another bunch along when I’m through with my
summer wash. I’ll just draw a dope of ten thousand
right away. Here’s the brief.” He passed a cheque
across the counter and waited to receive the money.</p>

<p>Burns looked up.</p>

<p>“Yes,” he said, seriously. “That’s the reckoning,
sure. I congratulate you. You certainly have a swell
claim.”</p>

<p>Cy nodded. “I certainly have,” he agreed shortly.</p>

<p>The teller passed the roll of bills and he and his
chief watched their customer bestow it in a hip pocket.
As he did so he revealed a heavy gun strapped about
his waist, and Victor, at least, realised it was there as
no mere ornament. Cy had said, “God help the son
of a mule who gets within a mile of it,” and somehow
this watching student of human nature realised that
“God’s help” would certainly be required in the circumstances.
This man was not the sort to stand at trifles.</p>

<p>Cy took his departure without the least ceremony,
and it was only the banker’s “So long” that forced
common politeness from him. They saw him mount
one of the two ponies outside, and they heard the
coarse oath with which he urged the weary creature<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
forward. Then came the sound of the heavy slash of
a quirt and the horses clattered away.</p>

<p>“A mighty tough proposition,” Burns laughed
quietly. “All the gold in that boy’s claim wouldn’t
tempt me to try and track him to his hiding-hole. I
guess he comes out of the mountains. An’ maybe
they’re somewhere across the border&mdash;seeing he’s not
registered. Well, there it is. Guess it’s no worry of
mine. We’re here to collect gold, and I’d say we’ve
collected a swell bunch from that boy.”</p>

<p>The teller laughed.</p>

<p>“Guess there’s certainly little else to collect from
him, anyway,” he said significantly.</p>

<span class="fs95">A Bunch of Humanity</span></h2>


<p class="drop-capy1">IT was the day of celebration at the Speedway. It
was the anniversary of its first opening and Max
Lepende had ordained that once a year high revel
should hold sway in commemoration of the foundation
of his fortunes. The Speedway was to Beacon Glory
what the Casino is to Monte Carlo. It was perhaps a
good deal more. But then, Monte Carlo is in the eyes
of society and Beacon Glory had somehow contrived
a position on the map more or less unrecorded. On
the whole the “Glory” citizens, as they loved to call
themselves, were well enough satisfied with their position.
It was convenient for many reasons, not the least
of which was the feeling of security it gave to most of
them, and the general immunity they enjoyed from the
legitimate consequences of offences committed against
society in earlier life.</p>

<p>Max, being of Italian extraction and flamboyant in
temperament, had built and designed it in the manner
that most appealed to him. The place was literally a
Bacchanalian temple, lavish with white and gold and
brilliant lights. It was gaudy with red furnishings
and glittering glass, and, generally speaking, was as
good an example of a whited sepulchre as the riot of
debased human passions, and the lavish brush of the
decorator could make of otherwise perfectly innocent
woodwork.</p>

<p>The place stared out on the city’s main thoroughfare<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
two blocks below the Plaza Hotel, a wide-fronted, be-pillared
edifice of two stories. In the brilliant summer
sunlight its whitened walls looked dispiritedly grey and
shabby, but in the dark months of winter its blaze of
electric light transformed it into a lure which the people
of Beacon Glory found impossible to resist.</p>

<p>Max had named it “The Palace of Pleasure.” But
then Max wore a pointed beard which concealed a pair
of full, red, something sensuous lips. Furthermore, he
wore the rest of his hair long, and a large, flowing
black cravat adorned the evening clothes he always
appeared in when presiding over the nightly orgy obtaining
in his establishment. Beacon Glory, being
frank, apt and unashamed in its downrightness of
phraseology, had promptly dubbed it “The Speedway,”
and, in the end, the ultra-artistic mind of its
founder had to yield, and as the “Speedway” it was
known throughout the length and breadth of southern
Alaska.</p>

<p>Max’s annual celebration was not lightly to be
missed, and, generally speaking, Beacon Glory was not
given to missing anything at other people’s expense.
Besides, Max would be offended if his available customers
absented themselves on this his especial night.
Then, too, why should it be missed? There would be
a dinner of exceptional quality in the grand dining-hall&mdash;free
to invited guests. There would be a flood
of wine of the best quality. The company, for once,
would smoke the best cigars and lap up expensive,
sticky cordials. And it would all be free. Oh, no.
There was no missing it by those men favoured with
an invitation.</p>

<p>There would be no women at the dinner; that was
where Max displayed his fineness of discrimination.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
He knew his men. And perhaps his women&mdash;some of
them. The women would be there for the dance afterwards&mdash;they
would be given a good time, but Max
sternly demanded that this, his evening of evenings,
should start&mdash;fair. Whatever the later developments,
the night should at least start with such dignity and
decorum as an assorted line in evening clothes could
impress upon the manhood of a more or less disreputable
out-world city.</p>

<p>The Plaza was unusually full in the late afternoon
on this day of celebration. The weather was hot and
windless, and the spring mosquitoes were merciless.
But the open verandah, overlooking the main avenue,
was liberally patronised. Mosquitoes were part of the
daily life of Beacon Glory, and their worst torture was
insufficient to disturb its citizens out of their routine.</p>

<p>Jubilee Hurst and his partner, Burt Riddell, were
amongst those foregathered. They were nominally
gold men of the type which is drawn from the big
cities of civilisation. They come at the call of adventure
and easy money, and in the end, generally seek
the latter by means of an active application of wit
rather than of muscle. Then there was the well-liked,
amiable and indifferent Doctor Finch, Beacon’s leading
man of medicine. He was reposing his rotund
figure in a chair of doubtful stability, tilted at a perilous
angle, while his heavily-booted feet decorated the rail
of the verandah. Abe Cranfield, the Plaza’s esteemed
proprietor, short, stout, and with a thrusting chin whisker,
was squatting on a low stool many sizes too small
for him. And, reposing comfortably in a prolonged
cane deck chair, with a Rye highball on an adjacent
table easily within reach, reclined Victor Burns of the
Occidental Bank.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span></p>

<p>None of them had as yet disguised themselves under
the uniform required for the evening’s entertainment
to which they were all invited. That was an evil they
preferred to postpone till the last minute. They one
and all preferred to remain the plain examples of Beacon’s
citizenship they really were as long as possible.</p>

<p>The irrepressible Jubilee Hurst made no pretence of
his reluctance, and he was airing his views with that
simple freedom which he claimed as his right at all
times.</p>

<p>“You know, boys,” he said, smashing a bunch of
mosquitoes on the back of his bull-like neck, “Max is
mostly a decent citizen for all he’s a Dago. But his
craze for patent shoes and hair oil gets me all the time.
You know, there’s no sort of reason in a guy acting
the way he does behind a bow-tie fit for a Dago revolutionary,
and wearing a sheath-knife on his hip fit to
carve up whale blubber. Maybe, with an elegant souse
in prospect he fancies us boys fixed the way he gets us
because most of our party suits were invented before
the possibilities of the hip-pocket were guessed about.
I’d say the Speeedway’s no sort of joint to fall into
without a whole darn arsenal of weapons lying around
to your hand most all the time, and, I’ll sure be feeling
like a lamb at slaughter time settin’ around disguised
like a first-class waiter, while he belches up his annual
hash of the pleasure it hands him having us suckers
around, and how grieved he is the cemetery’s added to
its stock of fancy mausoleums by way of advertising
the amenities of his darn booth.”</p>

<p>He smiled amiably round upon the company, and
took half a highball at a gulp. And his black, twinkling
eyes finally settled on his partner’s long and grievously
unsmiling face.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span></p>

<p>“It’s all right, boy,” he said, grinning genially.
“You needn’t to feel the way you’re lookin’. I got
two boiled shirts, and seein’ you’re a partner of mine,
I’ll share ’em with you for haf a dollar.”</p>

<p>Burt raked at the calf of one hairy leg exposed about
his sock suspender to the attacking mosquitoes.</p>

<p>“Oh, beat it,” he cried irritably. “You wouldn’t
miss a thing the Speedway could hand you, if Max
reckoned to have you around in your underpants.
You make me tired.” He turned to the banker. “I
got around the ‘Glory Hole’ this morning. It’s burnt
out stark.”</p>

<p>The banker sipped his highball and gazed thoughtfully
out at the far hills.</p>

<p>“I’m glad,” he said quietly, after a moment’s deliberation.</p>

<p>It was coldly said and Abe Cranfield looked round
at the speaker quickly.</p>

<p>“I can’t say I’m glad for any feller to get burnt out,”
he exclaimed warmly. “The Aurora bunch are acting
mighty gay. Wher’s it goin’ to stop? Is it the Plaza
or the Speedway next? How am I to know when
I’m offending their notions? Clancy Roscoe had been
runnin’ his saloon since ever Beacon started. I can’t
see&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“It was a brothel,” Burns spoke sharply. Then he
laughed quietly. “See here, Abe,” he said in a conciliatory
fashion, “I guess you hold a brief for Clancy
and his Glory Hole because he’s in your line of business&mdash;as
far as liquor’s concerned. You sort of feel
it’s interference with lawful liberty, and maybe, that
way you’re right. But there’s no right-minded boy to
this city’ll feel that the Clan has done anything but a
service to the credit of our burg. Clancy was warned.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
He showed me his written warning two weeks back
and he was right up in the air. And his warning was
straight and right. It said, ‘Clear out your women
and run your liquor joint straight.’ It gave him two
weeks. Well, he refused. And I got my notions of the
feller who makes his pay out of that sort of thing. He
banks with me and I can’t help it. But I’m glad his
shanty’s gone, and there are some more I’d like to see
treated the same.”</p>

<p>“Sounds like he was the Chief Light of the Aurora,”
laughed Jubilee.</p>

<p>Burns nodded.</p>

<p>“Maybe it does, boy. But think back to the days
when you were your mother’s kid and you’ll think like
me. No, I guess there’s a worry back of that Clan,
but not when they burn up joints like the ‘Glory
Hole.’”</p>

<p>Doc Finch nodded over his cigar stump.</p>

<p>“I’m with you, Victor,” he said seriously.</p>

<p>“I’m sure you are, Doc.”</p>

<p>“Well, what of Max’s show?” Abe was still considering
possibilities from a personal point of view.
“What of the women there? Are things better there
when you get right down to bedrock? Say, I want to
laff. Ther’s vice to the square inch right around that
dance hall ’ud pave hell a furlong a minute. But then,
Max could buy half the city,” he finished up bitterly.</p>

<p>“I can’t stand for that,” the unsmiling face of Burt
was suddenly transformed. He was grinning but in
real earnest. “The Speedway’s the thing folks make
it,” he said hotly. “It’s the only real joy spot in a city
that’s forgot how to laff. You can help yourself to
a portion of life there without a meal ticket. Ther’s
light and laughter there if you don’t get around with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
a grouch. You can burn money there, or make a
bunch, if you’re bright enough to beat the other feller.
Ther’s women who’re foolish, and women who ain’t,
and ther’s boys who’re a real imitation of men, and
hogs disguised under a bank roll. If the Clan was to
get after Max’s joint it ’ud be me for the coast and the
first barge for the south. No, Abe, if ther’s any sort
of method back of those guys in their white shirts and
pointed sky-pieces you and Max can sit around without
a worry. An’, anyway, this bum hotel couldn’t have
claim to vice, even in the dreams of a bughouse inmate.”</p>

<p>Jubilee chuckled as a preliminary to one of his characteristic
outbursts. Then he took in the whole company
in his expansive, headlong way.</p>

<p>“Burt’s got a hell of a hunch, an’ I won’t have to
charge him haf-a-dollar for that shirt,” he laughed
delightedly. “My, Abe, but he got you plumb in the
pit of the stomach. And he was right, sure. I guess
you can throw all the dirt you fancy in Beacon without
ever a chance of missin’ things. But the Speedway
ain’t available for that playing without hurtin’ folks
who’re mostly your friends. What ’ud we do without
the Speedway? Why, die plumb to death setting
around your verandah, smashin’ skitters. I can’t think
of dying worse.”</p>

<p>The grin died out of his eyes, and a curious sort of
earnestness replaced it as he went on:</p>

<p>“No, Abe,” he said, sitting up abruptly and spreading
out his lean, tenacious hands, which were carefully
manicured. “Get a grip on yourself and think of the
women-folk who get glad there at night. Do you
grudge ’em? No, sir, you don’t. You couldn’t. It’s
not in you. You know a woman hasn’t a swell time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
in life when you think about her. And in Beacon she
wouldn’t get any time at all.” He laughed again.
“We’re told the first woman was made out of man’s
‘scrap.’ Maybe that’s how it comes she’s had to put
up with man’s ‘left-over’ ever since.” He shook his
head. “To my thinking, woman’s never had a better
time than a yaller pup ever since she disappointed her
folk with her sex. It seems to me a poor sort of life
fixing a man’s hash so he don’t take too big a chance
on his life policy. Think how she needs to smile every
time a feller hands her out five cents to make vacation
on, same as if she was pleased. Chores seem to be
the limit of woman’s joy in life, and I guess she’ll go
right on chasing kids’ noses with a swab till she jerks
up at the graveyard. She’ll keep on trying to feed her
whole bunch on the change out of a dollar, and the
promises her man hands out to her like dead leaves
in the fall. She’s got a hell of a life, even if it’s only
she’s expected to swallow a man’s lies whole and sit
around foolish waiting for ’em to come true. No,
Abe, don’t you ever go for to rob her of a moment’s
pleasure. She’ll mother you sick, and mother you
well. She’ll lie for you and fight for you. And when
she’s broke her heart keepin’ folks from lynching you,
she’ll tidy you all she knows and pass you into the
crematorium in the hope of making you a real sanitary
proposition for the first time in your darn life. Ther’s
all sorts of ’em find joy in the Speedway. Some are
foolish, but,” he finished up, turning his perfectly serious
eyes in the direction of the great dance hall,
“ther’s those who&mdash;aren’t.”</p>

<p>At that instant a raucous honk! honk! echoed down
the wide, dust-laden, unkempt thoroughfare, and every
eye was turned in the direction.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span></p>

<p>Out of a dust cloud a high-powered automobile
raced down towards them, rolling and bumping over
the perilous unevennesses of the road, regardless of
every consequence. It was painted a curious rich red,
a big saloon body with black running gear and black
roof. It contained only two women, both expensively
clad, one of whom had a wealth of red hair that seemed
to match the colour of the vehicle. Every man on the
verandah was craning. Every eye was watching the
car’s reckless progress. And as it passed, leaving them
almost lost under a fog of dust, it was Doc Finch who,
returning his feet to their resting-place on the verandah
rail, voiced something of the thought that occurred to
the mind of each.</p>

<p>“No,” he said, smiling amiably round on the company,
“there’s no gang, or clan, or bunch of disorderly
toughs in Beacon Glory that ’ud dare to do harm to
the Speedway so long as St. Claire Carver is its patron
saint.”</p>

<p>The banker nodded prompt agreement.</p>

<p>“That’s a cinch, Doc,” he said. “She’s got every
man in Beacon just where any good woman could
want him.”</p>

<p>Abe concurred promptly, if grudgingly.</p>

<p>“She’s a real dandy an’ a good spender,” he admitted,
“and she’s got the whole fancy of Beacon as
well as its luck&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Luck?” Victor Burns drained the remains of his
highball to wash the dust of the automobile from his
throat. “She’s made a pile that would set some of the
Wall Street guys screaming. Say!” He laughed.
Then he became serious. “And talking of gold and
things,” he went on, “there’s colour coming in just
now from outside. A boy bought himself a credit at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
my place this afternoon for eighty thousand odd, and
it was the sort of dust they used to collect on ‘Eighty-Mile’
years back.”</p>

<p>The banker watched the almost electrical effect of
his words on a company to whom gold was the beginning
and end of everything. Discussion of the Speedway
and its morals, and even of its beautiful patron
saint, was forgotten. Every man at once sat agog.
And even Jubilee Hurst, who was mainly a sheer gambler,
who had been gazing down the avenue after the
now-vanished automobile, eagerly sought information.</p>

<p>“Where did it come from?” he asked, without hesitation
or scruple.</p>

<p>Burns shook his head.</p>

<p>“Search me,” he said with a laugh.</p>

<p>“Who’s the guy?” demanded Burt.</p>

<p>“Guess I’m a banker.”</p>

<p>“Can’t you hand us a thing?” inquired Abe.</p>

<p>“Not a thing but just that,” Burns said quietly.
“It’s the third big bunch of dust come in from the
same place, by the same boy, in six months. And
there’s more coming. I wanted you fellows to know
about it because it’s my job to collect the stuff, and the
more folks know about it the more they’ll worry to get
after it. There’s big gold coming into Beacon, and I
guess that’s the best news you&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>He broke off. Ivor McLagan had appeared in the
open glass doorway leading on to the verandah.</p>

<p>“Say,” he cried, after a moment’s pause, “I hadn’t
a notion you were in town, Ivor.”</p>

<p>Jubilee laughed.</p>

<p>“You ain’t much of a guesser, Burns,” he interjected.
“Why wouldn’t McLagan be along in? Is he
missing Max’s show any more than you and me? But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
say, Mac, tell us about oil. We just been hearing gold
from Burns and now we want oil. The oil king is
right with us, folk. He’s right in our midst,” he cried,
with his ready laugh. “The soft yellow stuff gets us
all the time, but nice, black, sticky oil’s only a short
cut to it. You’re the guy to grease the wheels of Beacon
right. Gold won’t be a circumstance when you
open out one of your gushers. Sit around, man, and
hand us news that’ll help us digest Max’s Dago feast
right. Talk to us of options and borings and coal
mountains, and all that sort of truck you can’t eat and
I’ll buy you a highball right now, and swear to set up
a swell piece by way of epitaph on your mausoleum
when you’ve got mired to death in the juice you’re
going to flood Beacon with. You’re our only hope
of&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“And a darnation poor one, Jubilee,” McLagan interrupted,
“that is, right up to now.” He pulled up a
chair and leaned his great body over it, while his plain
face smiled indulgently on the irrepressible man who
never failed to amuse him. “But we’re right on oil.
We’ve hit a&mdash;trickle. A hell of a fine&mdash;trickle.”</p>

<p>Abe sat up.</p>

<p>“Is that right?” he demanded, his eyes lighting.</p>

<p>Ivor nodded.</p>

<p>“It surely is, Abe. You’ll be re-building this hogpen
in a year’s time and you’ll need to add a hundred
rooms.”</p>

<p>Burns leant forward in his chair.</p>

<p>“Is it going to be big?”</p>

<p>“A real flood&mdash;if I’m not foolish.”</p>

<p>“Will you talk to-night at Max’s feed?” inquired
Doc Finch, a staunch believer in publicity.</p>

<p>“Not a whisper.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span></p>

<p>“Why not?” inquired Burt Riddell.</p>

<p>“Because I got a deal too much that’s worth saying,”
McLagan laughed. “The only time it’s safe to
talk is when you haven’t.”</p>

<p>Jubilee chuckled appreciatively.</p>

<p>“I’m buying that highball right away, Abe,” he cried.
“And make it for the whole darn house, if it’s my last
buck. McLagan’s right. Don’t shout till you want.
Then shout like hell. Folk’ll hand it you if it’s only
to keep you quiet while they shout. Oil? And it’s
coming? Are there any options lying around? Are
we to be in on the ground floor, Mac, or is the darn
door bolted and locked?”</p>

<p>McLagan shook his head.</p>

<p>“Sure it’s locked and I’ve hidden up the key,” he
said quietly. “My prospect’s a tight one. You see,
it’s been a long trail and I’m taking no chances. Easy
money’s fine for those who make it. But I’m not passing
easy money to a soul. Guess I’ll go and clean up
for Max’s party.” He laughed pleasantly. “And I’ll
collect your highball on the way, boy. So long.”</p>

<span class="fs95">The Speedway</span></h2>


<p class="drop-capy1">MAX LEPENDE, for all Jubilee Hurst’s estimate
of him, was a creature of unusual mentality.
His ability was quite beyond question; his morals were
something of a less buoyant nature; while his poses
were wholly Latin in their extravagance, and contrived
to set up an impenetrable armour against those who
sought to discover the real man underneath.</p>

<p>The Speedway was the reality of his own dream.
Its inspiration was a product of memories and experiences
of early life in a land of beauty and an
atmosphere of bygone glories. And as such it was a
sufficient anachronism in its present setting to grip the
imagination of the crude minds which made up the
clientele he hoped to pillage in the outland territory
he had chosen for his hunting ground.</p>

<p>He boasted the refinements of his designing, and
was mercilessly jealous of the Speedway’s fame. The
attitude of other minds was less benevolent towards it.
The citizens of Beacon Glory were prone at all times to
downrightness, and, consequently, they set no halo
about the place. But they delighted in the licence it afforded
them for indulgence in pleasant surroundings.</p>

<p>The fronting colonnade of five gaudily decorated
pillars meant nothing to the citizens of Beacon Glory.
Yet they sometimes marvelled at the costliness and the
extent of the white paint that looked so drab in the
sunlight. Some never even paused to consider the rich<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
carpetings they trod underfoot in the gaming rooms,
or the wonderful block-flooring over which their heavy
boots glided in the great dance hall. But there were
few enough who failed to appreciate the raised private
boxes which lined the walls of the latter, furnished as
they were with drinking tables, and deeply upholstered
chairs and divans, and hung with curtains to be drawn
at will. Then there was the glitter of innumerable
mirrors, and the broad staircase with its carved balustrades
leading to the rooms above, where every game
from “crap dice” to “baccarat” could be indulged in.</p>

<p>The general run of the men and women of Beacon
Glory demanded a good time. And the Speedway,
under Max’s consummate guidance and absolute control,
provided for their every need in this direction.
Oh, yes, Max saw to that. For underneath his patient,
smiling veneer, and his pose of polished respectability,
he possessed a hard, unyielding, astute commercial soul,
greedy for the last cent of profit he could extract from
his customers.</p>

<p>Hardened trail men, no less than educated men from
the cities of culture in the outer world, yielded to the
seductions of the Speedway. So did the women, who
regarded it as a part of their daily lives. The charm
of subdued lights in the gaming rooms; the dazzle and
glitter at the gilded bars, and in the dance hall; the
subtle, rather sickly perfume of the place, the value of
which Max so perfectly understood; these things all
contributed to make it a veritable temple for the spiritual
debasement of its devotees.</p>

<p>On the night of its birthday the Speedway was swept
and garnished to the last degree. Fashion and custom
were no less strong in Beacon than in the more enlightened
dwelling-places of humanity. Every visitor to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
place would be clad for the occasion. No woman
would dare to appear for the festival without some
sort of a new gown. And as for the men, knee-boots
would be taboo, and heavy working shoes were under
the ban. Every man who was accustomed to resort
there would be raiding the shoe store the day before,
and, failing evening suits as part of their wardrobes,
certainly only the best they possessed could be tolerated.</p>

<p>It was truly a splendid function and possessed all
the outward display with which humanity loves to hide
up the wealth of moral blemish to which it is unfortunately
and unfailingly heir. The place was super-heated
and the air was heavy-laden, and Max, as he
welcomed his customers and guests, radiated smile,
and perfume, and punctilio without discrimination.</p>

<p>Jubilee Hurst, observing him after enduring his own
portion of the formalities at the foot of the great staircase
in the central hall, realised to the full the delicious
mockery of it all. He whispered his comment to Ivor
McLagan, who stood beside him, clad in the well-cut
evening suit that was anathema to his downright soul.</p>

<p>“You know, Mac, there’s a heap to Max of the
feline species. He’s a mitt on him that ’ud shame
velvet, and a tongue to match, and I feel plumb sick in
the pit of the stomach, and like handling a newly
hooked eel, when I get near enough to listen to his
fancy dope, and feel the tips of his polished fingers in
my hand. Get a line on him bowing around to folks
whose bank roll he’s made his life’s study. See his
Dago antics. You’d guess he loves us all to death,
while all the time he’s out for plunder like any ‘hold-up’
that ever flagged a western express. And we’re all
grinning back at him to schedule. And we’re all saying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
a piece we’ve sort of learnt by heart from years of
repetition. Can you beat it? No. I’ll eat his darn
feed an’ likely get full up to the back teeth with the
liquor he’s going to hand out. But to me it’s simply
the change out of the dollars he’s collected out of my
wad over a long period of darn foolishness. It isn’t
a thing else, unless it’s to say I’m just one of the
mutts of life mired at the wrong end of things, an’
can’t afford to act diff’rent.”</p>

<p>McLagan smiled.</p>

<p>“Don’t worry a thing, boy,” he said easily. “It’s
just the game of things we’ve all of us got to play more
or less as we beat it along the trail to the crematorium.
I’d certainly say Max don’t need showing a thing. I
want to laff.”</p>

<p>But for all the bitterness of spirit the Italian’s antics
might have inspired in those who saw through the
mockery of it all, the whole comedy looked to be playing
out as the master-mind had designed. It was ordained
that the gathering at the Speedway, on this one night
in the year, should be a vivid landmark impressed upon
the minds of the city’s people, from the banquet to the
invited guests, to the ball, and the great gamble that
would later take place at the tables. There would be
impressive decorum for just as long as decorum could
be maintained. And after that, circumstances and the
proprietor’s tact, and, failing that, his powers of other
persuasion, would deal with every contingency that
arose. There would be nothing allowed to occur on
that occasion calculated to besmirch the record of the
place. That was Max’s purpose. A purpose from
which he had no intention of departing.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The banquet was over and the company had dispersed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
in such directions as individual inclination
prompted. Max had thrown his annual shower of
verbal bouquets, and had drunk in the responsive
adulation and laudatory expressions which custom demanded
from his guests. The courses had been disposed
of by healthy appetites which refused to be disguised,
and an excellent brand of champagne had
flowed in no niggard measure to lubricate faculties
that were easily enough set in motion for full appreciation
of the night’s riot. The ballroom was already
thronged with dancers of every grade of ability, and
the lure of the tables had claimed their devotees.
While not a few were sufficiently attracted by the magnetic
glitter of the bars where the white-clad bartenders
were under orders to dispense of their best
mixtures without charge.</p>

<p>Ivor McLagan and some of his friends had passed
over the attractions of everything else for the shaded
lights of the poker hall. It was a spacious apartment
with panelled walls of dark green to match the colour
of the baize-covered tables. It was carpeted thickly
with oriental reds and blues, and such woodwork as
there was was gleaming white. The tables were spaced
evenly round the walls, with one only somewhat larger
than the rest, occupying the centre of the room. The
place was entered from a landing just beyond a wide,
decorated archway hung with curtains, and this, in
turn, gave on to the head of the great staircase.</p>

<p>It was a room with which little enough fault could
be found. For, apart from the charm of its shaded
rose lighting, it was governed by a number of unwritten
laws so that its company could pursue its devotions
without let or hindrance, or any disturbing element.
The chip bureau was presided over by a seemingly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
voiceless autocrat, while velvet-footed waiters ministered
to the thirst of everybody in the efficient manner
of well-drilled club servants. It was all admirably
calculated to yield the best possible profit out of a
mixed company which consisted of men and women of
substance and undeniable beauty, down to the rough-clad
trail men who sold their “dust” for chips, and
a gambling fraternity of every shade of colour and
almost every race.</p>

<p>Outwardly it was a sheer delight for those who were
sufficiently young and reckless. It was a place to grip
the imagination. Inwardly, or underneath its surface
of pleasant seeming, there was perhaps a different aspect.
There was not one of the immaculate waiters
who was not a trained athlete in his ability to deal with
the toughest human violence, and each man was fully
armed with an automatic pistol or some other lethal
weapon. Then the voiceless president at the chip
bureau was a dead shot, and had under his fingers a
system of switches which could summon any aid he
needed and close every exit of the establishment, at an
instant’s notice.</p>

<p>McLagan had made no attempt to cut into any of the
games that had already started. For the moment he
and the rotund Dr. Finch and Jubilee Hurst were onlookers.
Jubilee was sitting on an unoccupied table,
while the two others were smoking Max’s cigars,
watching the game in progress at the next table.</p>

<p>The doctor and Jubilee seemed more deeply interested
than was the oil man. A poker game was irresistible
to Jubilee at all times. Doc Finch had partaken
of a sufficiently good dinner to find interest in
anything, provided it was witnessed from a comfortable
chair. But McLagan’s attention undisguisedly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
wandered to the curtained entrance every time the
hangings were drawn aside to admit a newcomer.</p>

<p>He was a keen poker player, but only as a pastime.
And he rarely drifted into any of the really big games
that were played at the Speedway. Just now he had
no desire at all to participate in any of them. He was
by no means a part of the Speedway’s human freight.
But for months, now, he had never failed to spend his
evenings in its scented atmosphere when business demanded
his presence in the city.</p>

<p>Jubilee shook his carefully oiled head in response to
McLagan’s challenge.</p>

<p>“No, I’m not cutting in yet,” he said. Then he
added with a grin, indicating the table in front of them,
“Guess I couldn’t make a one-night hotel bill out of a
bunch like that. See that guy open a fi’ dollar jack
pot, an’ throw in at the first bet? They’re a close
bunch, without the nerve to buck four aces right. I’ll
wait for the Saint.”</p>

<p>McLagan’s quick eyes shot a sharp look into a grinning
face.</p>

<p>“She plays a great game,” he observed quietly.</p>

<p>“Game? It’s a gift.” Jubilee chuckled. “If she’d
take me as partner,” he went on with meaning, “we’d
clean up half the world.”</p>

<p>McLagan removed his cigar and dropped its ash into
the fixed tray provided on the table on which Jubilee
was sitting.</p>

<p>“Have you put it to her?” he asked smilingly.</p>

<p>The other shook his head.</p>

<p>“Not on your life, Mac,” he said seriously. “I’m
sure like every other guy around the way I feel but
I’ve a sight too big a respect for a good woman to
want to tie her up to the kind of life I live. Maybe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
sometime I’ll make the pile I mostly dream about, and
I’ll be able to quit the game I’ve always run. Well,
when that time comes, and I’ve learnt Sunday School
ways, I’ll be feeling and acting pious. Maybe it ’ud be
different then. Say, Doc’s doping off his feed.”</p>

<p>“You’re wrong, boy.” The Doctor bestirred himself.
“But likely enough I was dreaming. I thought
I heard you talking of acting&mdash;pious. I&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>He broke off. The curtains had been abruptly
drawn aside from the great archway. Two of the
waiters were holding them back. Suddenly there was
a curious hissing sound somewhere up in the shadows
about the domed ceiling. The next moment a fierce
light flashed out, filling the archway with the white-circle
of its beam. It was a “spot lime,” and it fell on
the tall, slim figure of a beautifully gowned girl as
she appeared from the landing beyond. It was Max’s
greeting, on the night of celebration, to the beautiful
Saint of his beloved Speedway.</p>

<p>Just for an instant Claire Carver stood dazzled by
the glare of the unexpected light. Every eye in the
room was turned in her direction to discover the meaning
of the terrific blaze. And in that moment Ivor
McLagan feasted himself upon the vision he had been
awaiting.</p>

<p>The girl was clad in an expensive sort of semi-evening
gown of soft, black material, aglitter with the
shining surfaces of a myriad of black beads. At her
waist was a large, sprawling artificial flower that
matched the ruddy tone of her vivid hair. She was
without gloves, and her rounded arms of alabaster
whiteness were bare to the shoulder, and her gown
below the knees revealed sheeny silk stockings which
terminated in high-arched insteps and exquisite shoes.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
But her glory was the hat adorned with flowing Paradise
plumes, and the wealth of her hair framing a face
whose beauty set the pulses of the gazing man hammering.</p>

<p>Never in his life had McLagan seen Claire a creature
so exquisite. And there flashed through his mind a
memory of the girl of the headland, tortured by the
threat of Bad Booker’s usurious terms. The change,
the complete transformation, was amazing. There
had been change before. He had seen it and delighted
in it. But there had been nothing like this. This was
the girl’s party gown. He understood that. She
was&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>“God o’ my fathers!”</p>

<p>Jubilee breathed his astonished admiration into McLagan’s
ears, and was promptly silenced by a look.</p>

<p>Somewhat embarrassed Claire came down the room
with heightened colour, and eyes that smiled almost
shyly. It was the same sweet face which McLagan
had always known. Only it lacked something of that
natural freshness which the wind and the sun of the
coast had bestowed upon it in her days on Lively
Creek. The downy bloom of those days had been replaced
by a suggestion of powder. Even her pretty
lips seemed to have gained added ripeness from the
careful touch of cosmetic. But the wide blue eyes, the
even brows, and the rounded, perfectly moulded cheeks
were the same, and, to the man’s thinking, even more
beautiful.</p>

<p>But some of the delight McLagan felt as the girl
came quickly towards him passed at once as he beheld
the figure of Max close behind her. Many a night he
had looked on at the centre table where Claire always
played, and had even found amusement in observing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
the crowd of men of all conditions who never failed
to gather like moths about a candle flame. He had
watched them in their frantic efforts to win her ready
smile, and it had filled him only with added pleasure
in her beauty and simple charm.</p>

<p>But the sight of Max at that moment, with his sleek,
dark head, and his carefully cut close beard, his immaculate
clothes, and his good-looking foreign face,
inspired a feeling he had never before experienced.
He remembered the method of this girl’s entrance.
The elaborate staginess of it. And he realised that
Max had not designed an entrance for the most popular
gambler in Beacon Glory. No. It was for the woman
herself. And Max was rich and powerful, and without
scruple. And, furthermore, with immense resources
for achieving any purpose upon which he set his mind.</p>

<p>Anger rose behind the man’s keen eyes, and their
usual easy humour was changed to a glitter that had
nothing mild or yielding in it.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<span class="fs95">The Man from the Lias River</span></h2>


<p class="drop-capy1">THE little burst of applause which greeted Claire’s
entrance had died out. Like the stage light that
had descended upon her it had left her with a slight
feeling of embarrassment. But she understood that
the men, at least, if not the women, were in the mood
to applaud anything and everything, for it was a night
of festival. It was the first of its kind she had attended.
She had known by tradition what was expected,
and had seen to it that she played her part.
So her gown was the most expensive she could import
from Seattle and the largish beaded handbag she was
carrying was packed with a roll of money of unusually
large proportions.</p>

<p>In the brief eight months since Claire had plunged
into the vortex of the Speedway’s gaming life she had
become a victim of the fever of it all. Her original
purpose had been the simple betterment of her fortunes
and those of her mother. She had desired nothing
more. For, in her heart, she had no sympathy with the
reputation of the place. The whole idea had been cold
business. But by degrees her viewpoint had changed,
and the rich youth in her had gained ascendency. The
place, the life, the game, swiftly took possession of
her, and all of the dead father latent in her young soul
had stirred to an irresistible passion. The lure of that
centre table she had made hers, the rattle of the chips,
the feel of the delicate pasteboards in her nimble fingers,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
were all things she had come to live for. She had
learned to love it all with a real passion.</p>

<p>In the process of time there had been scarcely a
moment of disillusion. Her beauty had gained her a
deep place in the hearts of the men. And the women,
whatever their real feelings, bowed before a creature
whom the other sex had set on so exalted a pedestal.
Then her skill; her spirit. At the realisation of these
things even the women stood by in frank admiration,
while her amazing good fortune filled them with superlative
envy.</p>

<p>Claire had been staunch and true to herself and her
purpose. Never once had there fallen a lapse. She
eschewed the vices she witnessed in others of her sex
who haunted the place, while she gave full run to her
capacity for sheer enjoyment. Never once in the
thirsty, heated atmosphere of the place had she permitted
any beverage more harmful than a mineral
water to pass her pretty lips. She revelled in the scent
of the tobacco with which men and women filled the
atmosphere. But she had not the slightest inclination
to essay the mildest of cigarettes herself. Then, too,
she had swiftly discovered herself to be possessed of
an unerring instinct in defence against the ardent and
often crude advances she was constantly encountering
amongst the wild youth with which she found herself
surrounded.</p>

<p>She had been dubbed “The Saint” from the earliest
days of her career at the Speedway. And it was a
natural enough appellation. Her given name had suggested,
and her methods had inspired. It was the jealous
minds of her own sex which had coined the designation.
And the manhood of the city had taken it up
in real affection.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span></p>

<p>Before passing to her table Claire came over to the
seat where McLagan’s great figure was lounging. And
her greeting of him had in it no lessening of their old
friendliness.</p>

<p>“Why, Ivor,” she cried, “I didn’t guess you’d be
along in town. This is real fine on a party night. And&mdash;and”&mdash;her
lighting eyes surveyed his evening suit&mdash;“say,
don’t you look swell? You see, I always sort of
expect you in your tough old pea-jacket.”</p>

<p>The man’s plain face was alight with undisguised
pleasure. He shook his head, and his small eyes twinkled.</p>

<p>“Don’t just say a thing, Claire,” he said quietly.
“If you knew the way I feel I guess you’d hand me all
the pity you know. I am hating myself under a boiled
shirt, but I had to be around to-night anyway. And
I’m glad. I’d have missed that dandy gown of yours
else, and the picture you’re looking. You’ve got Beacon
plumb dazzled and me well-nigh blinded.”</p>

<p>The girl flushed and laughed, but she left his compliment
unanswered.</p>

<p>“Are you going to sit in at my table?” she asked.
Then with real sincerity, “I’d be glad.”</p>

<p>But again McLagan shook his head.</p>

<p>“No, Claire,” he said reflectively. “I got other notions
being here to-night. Besides,” he added with a
smile, “my bank roll isn’t equal to better than table-stakes,’
and that’s no sort of use when <em>you</em> get busy.
I’ll just sit around awhile. There’s Jubilee yearning
to lighten your wad. He sat right in on the jump
when you came along, and I don’t fancy he’ll squeal
when you’re through with him. No, I’m waiting on
Victor Burns, and one or two boys. I can do business
here, and&mdash;I’ve pleased Max coming.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span></p>

<p>Claire glanced round at her table and her eyes were
no longer smiling. Her table had filled with the men
with whom she was accustomed to play, and they were
waiting on her pleasure.</p>

<p>“Why must you please Max?” she asked a little
sharply. “Why is it all of you men reckon to please
Max?” Suddenly she lowered her voice and inclined
towards him. “He’s gone off to the dance hall so I
don’t mind. I’m getting to hate him like I used to hate
Booker months back. That play of his just now with
his light. It sickened me. It surely did, Ivor. And
he’s getting like a tame cat. And I hate cats. Give
me a dog all the time, and a good, rough, fighting trail
husky at that.”</p>

<p>McLagan nodded. His eyes were smiling inscrutably.</p>

<p>“Don’t worry with him,” he said. “Don’t worry
with any feller. Max has his uses, which don’t need
to concern you. But your boys are looking gun-play
my way.”</p>

<p>Claire laughed. The man was dismissing her. This
big, burly, plain creature who had persistently asked
her to marry him. Just for a moment a sense of pique
disturbed her, but it passed immediately, lost in her
laugh. There was no other man in that room would
have done the same. She nodded at him and took her
dismissal.</p>

<p>“Swell clothes hide up all sorts of things, I guess,”
she cried, as she moved away, “but it’s queer how the
rough in a man can leak through. I guess those boys
at the table won’t be in such a hurry to lose me.”</p>

<p>She was gone. And with her going a sense of loneliness
at once stole in on McLagan. He desired her for
himself. He desired Claire Carver above all things in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
the world. He could cheerfully have driven the crowd
about her table headlong. But that was the feeling that
was his at all times at the sight of the men who gathered
about her. However, he had come there with a
resolve from which he would not deviate, and, in accordance
with that which lay at the back of his mind,
he had dismissed her to the game which he knew was
her passionate delight.</p>

<p>Victor Burns had just passed the curtained archway,
and hard on his heels was a newcomer who at
once claimed all McLagan’s interest. For a moment
he observed the man while the banker strolled leisurely
over towards him. He was a broad, powerful creature
in dark clothes, with a pea-jacket tightly buttoned over
his chest. His face was clean-shaven and dark, but
his eyes were of the palest hue of blue, and as expressionless
as those of a dead codfish. It was his eyes
that interested McLagan most, and Burns came up
almost before he was aware of it.</p>

<p>Burns laughed.</p>

<p>“Hello, Mac, where are the boys? Busy? You
seem to be having all sorts of a time to yourself. I’ll
hail a flunkey an’ collect a cocktail.”</p>

<p>McLagan edged round towards the empty chair
which the banker took possession of.</p>

<p>“Nothing for me, Victor,” he said brusquely. “Jubilee’s
in the game there, and the Doc’s oozed off to get
a look at the dames in the dance room. Abe’s passed
back to his own booth, and young Burt Riddell’s sitting
in where his game can’t butt in on his partner’s.” He
laughed. “We’re outside it all, eh?”</p>

<p>“I surely am,” the banker admitted promptly as he
surveyed the crowd. “You can’t run a bank and play
big money at the Speedway. Say&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span></p>

<p>He broke off as he caught sight of the man with the
pale blue eyes thrusting his way unceremoniously
through the crowd about Claire’s table. McLagan followed
the direction of his gaze.</p>

<p>“Who’s that tough-looking guy?” he asked quickly.</p>

<p>“Cy Liskard,” the banker said. “He’s a client of
mine. And he’s full to the back teeth with dollars and
dust. And,” he added slowly, “looks like he is with
liquor, too. Guess he’s out for a time. He’ll get it if
he sits into the Saint’s game. She’ll skin him to
death.”</p>

<p>The stranger’s movements were rough and forceful.
He made no pretence. The crowd where he joined it
about Claire’s table was at least three deep. It was
composed of men in every fashion of clothing, and
women whose faces were sufficiently disguised under
paint to hide up the worst traces of aging and dissipation.
He shouldered his way through and came to a
halt immediately behind one of the players. McLagan
wondered at the ease, the impunity, with which his purpose
was accomplished.</p>

<p>“He’s a roll of ten thousand in his hip pocket, and
I can’t say how much more. I wonder the kind of game
he’s got lying back of those dead eyes of his.”</p>

<p>Burns spoke reflectively, but his companion made no
answer. McLagan had bestirred himself out of his
seat. He had perched himself up on its arm, the better
to view the scene. His gaze was on the stranger and
was swiftly reading the thing that must have been
obvious to any onlooker sufficiently interested. The
man was clearly under the influence of drink, but by
no means drunk, and his “dead eyes,” as Burns had
called them, were fixed in a devouring stare upon the
girl at the far end of the table. It was not the game<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
that claimed the man. No, it was the girl, who remained
utterly unconscious of his regard, lost in the
absorbing interest of the hand she was playing.</p>

<p>“You know, Mac,” Burns went on, after a moment’s
contemplation of the man, “there’s faces with features
that mark a man down in a feller’s reckoning, and
leave him with an opinion that he’s no right to on the
face of things. But his feeling generally proves right
in the end. That boy’s eyes leave me cold in the spine,”
he laughed. “To me they’re the eyes of a dead soul.
To me, they’re the eyes of a feller who’d better have
been smothered at birth. I’d hate&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>He broke off. Above the murmur of voices with
which the room was filled the tones of a voice jarred
harshly. It was Cy Liskard, and he was speaking to
the man behind whose chair he was standing.</p>

<p>“I want to cut in right away,” he was saying.
“Ther’s fi’ hundred dollars for your chair, Mister.
Does it go?”</p>

<p>McLagan had straightened up from his lounging attitude.
Burns, too, was on his feet, and both had
moved nearer to the table. Five hundred dollars offered
for a “cut-in.” It was sufficiently extravagant.
And every eye of those standing around was on the
stranger who made the offer.</p>

<p>A few moments passed. The hand came to an end,
the pot passing to the man whom the stranger had
sought to buy out. Then there came movement, and
the player’s voice made itself heard.</p>

<p>“Hand us the dough,” he said sharply. “You can
cut right in. If you’ve the nerve to bid five hundred
for a chair, I guess you’re more entitled to it than
me.”</p>

<p>He rose from his place and Cy Liskard dropped into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
it. Then he made his way through the smiling crowd.</p>

<p>“Fifteen hundred dollars for six hands leaves me at
peace with the world,” he said, as he approached McLagan
and the banker. “Ain’t that so, Mac?” he asked,
with a wink.</p>

<p>He stood for a moment looking back at the table,
and his smile of self-satisfaction suddenly faded out
of his eyes.</p>

<p>“I’m kind of sorry I fell for it, though,” he said,
lowering his voice. “That guy’s haf soused, and I’ve
let him into <em>her</em> table.”</p>

<p>“Maybe it’s just as well you did, Soo.”</p>

<p>Soo Tybert stared at McLagan wonderingly. He
was a burly youngster, partner in a dry goods store,
and hailed from his father’s wholesale house in Seattle.</p>

<p>“How so?” he asked.</p>

<p>McLagan shrugged.</p>

<p>“He meant cutting in, anyway.”</p>

<p>Burns smiled.</p>

<p>“I guess the Saint’s going to have a swell night,” he
said. “Mister Cy’ll be along in the morning to replenish
his dollar reserves. Can you beat these boys who
come easy by the stuff lying around the creeks? Haf
a highball under their belts and the good air of the hills
blown out of their vitals, and they’re as ready to pass
on their stuff as an elderly, new-made widow-woman.”</p>

<p>But McLagan and the dry goods boy were paying no
heed to the banker’s reflections. They were talking
earnestly in a low tone, and when they had finished,
Soo made a somewhat hurried departure.</p>

<p>“Where’s he gone?” asked Burns, when McLagan
returned to his side.</p>

<p>“To hunt up Max.”</p>

<p>“Why?” The banker’s keen eyes had sobered, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
a sharp look of doubt accompanied his interrogation.</p>

<p>McLagan indicated the table at which Claire presided.</p>

<p>“What d’you know of Cy Liskard?” he asked, curtly.</p>

<p>“Not a thing. He’s a customer at the bank, that’s
all. He’s on pay dirt and hit it good.”</p>

<p>“Where?”</p>

<p>“Don’t know.”</p>

<p>Burns shrugged. But the look in his friend’s eyes
interested him.</p>

<p>“There’ll be trouble before the night’s out. I’m
going to stop around.”</p>

<p>McLagan’s words came sharply, but in a tone only
meant for the banker’s ears. There was a curious hard
set to his plain face, and his small eyes were coldly
bright. Victor Burns held him in deep regard, and his
understanding of him was the understanding of years
of intimate association. He had long since probed
McLagan’s interest in Claire Carver, and made his
estimate of it. And now, as he observed the man’s
hard-set look, he realised something of the depths to
which he was stirred.</p>

<p>“You don’t need to worry,” he said quietly.
“There’s no man around here to-night crazy enough
to play tough&mdash;not to-night.”</p>

<p>McLagan’s reply came with cold conviction.</p>

<p>“Ordinarily, I’d say you’re right, Victor. But ther’s
mischief back of that feller’s eyes. He paid five hundred
to cut in. Why? For a hand at poker? Not on
your life. I’m going to get in and watch the game.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>McLagan was far too familiar with the poker games
played at the Speedway to concern himself with the
bigness of the game he was looking on at. It mattered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
little enough to him the relative value of the heavy
red, white and blue chips. Their value might be
twenty-five, fifty and one hundred calculated in cents
or dollars. It made no impression whatsoever upon
his imagination, but the skill of the players was a
never-failing source of interest. The human psychology
in the game was fascinating beyond words.</p>

<p>To him the young girl, who seemed literally to have
given up her life to the lure of the game, was the epitome
of all that was demanded of human nature in
the play. Her beautiful face smiled or remained serious
as mood inclined her. But no change in it was
wrought or influenced by the progress of the game.
Her mood seemed at all times buoyant, and her flashes
of inspiration came and passed without a moment of
apparent effort or hesitation. In three hands she had
her opponent’s measure with an instinct and observation
that were unerring, while she played her own hand
with the baffling inconsequence which only a beautiful
woman could achieve. The values of every hand, estimated
through her understanding of her opponent’s
methods, were instinctive knowledge to her, and she
played on the instant at all times, while her skill in the
draw proclaimed her utter and complete mistress of
the game.</p>

<p>A hand had been dealt since Cy Liskard had sat in
and the ante had remained unchallenged. Now a jack-pot
was being dealt for. Claire’s smile was good to
watch, and a light of deep absorption was shining behind
her beautiful eyes. She dealt the hand, and sat
waiting for the opening or passing of the jack-pot.</p>

<p>Jubilee shook his head and closed his cards up. The
next man refused. Cy Liskard picked up some chips
and counted them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span></p>

<p>“I’m opening for ‘fifty,’” he said, while his curious
eyes levelled themselves at the dealer. “Guess that
calls a hundred.”</p>

<p>The hush was profound. The onlookers foresaw a
big gamble if all the table came in. Then again, it
might be a crude bluff on the part of this man who
was almost a stranger to them.</p>

<p>McLagan was observing the man with almost cat-like
watchfulness. Victor Burns was smiling interestedly,
wondering the while how long his customer
would last in the hands of these skilled and merciless
gamblers. To him there was, there could be, no doubt
as to the end. This man would stand no chance. He
would stand no more chance than a lamb in the midst
of a wolf pack.</p>

<p>Of the six players at the table Jubilee alone refused
to come in. He threw his cards in and sat back while
Claire began to deal for the draw. The betting started
at fifty dollars, and the spectators’ interest deepened,
for, after the draw, all but Claire and the man who had
opened the pot threw in their hands.</p>

<p>Claire’s instant response to the stranger was a raise
to five hundred dollars.</p>

<p>It was the sort of thing expected of her, and interest
deepened. Cy Liskard had drawn two cards, and the
smiling dealer had matched his draw. There could be
no indication as to what either of the players held
beyond the fact that the man had opened the pot.</p>

<p>Cy’s response was slower in coming. He glanced
at his cards and closed them instantly. Then, in a moment,
he raised the girl’s bet by one hundred dollars.</p>

<p>McLagan never for an instant withdrew his gaze
from the man, for it was the man who interested him.
It seemed to him the dead eyes had somehow come to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
life under the purpose driving him, and he was endeavouring
to read and grasp that purpose. To McLagan
it was a face masking completely every sign of
emotion, but he felt that emotion was burning deeply
behind the lustreless eyes, and somehow the conviction
of lurking evil was irresistible.</p>

<p>Victor Burns, like all the rest around the table, had
eyes only for the beautiful woman, with her graceful
figure a-shimmer with the twinkling beads of her
gown, and with her wealth of vivid hair under her
modish hat framing a face which he was never tired of
gazing upon.</p>

<p>Claire smiled her prompt reply, her lips parting and
revealing a row of perfect teeth as she “saw” the bet
and raised it another five hundred. The challenge was
thrilling and on the instant every eye focussed on the
man at the end of the table.</p>

<p>He raised his strange eyes and gazed hardly into
those of the girl, and as he passed his chips into the
centre of the table, McLagan drew a deep breath.</p>

<p>“Curse it, ther’s your fi’ hundred, an’ another on top
of it. Will you see it?”</p>

<p>“Surely. And raise it.” Claire’s retort came in
tones of smiling, unruffled calm. “It’ll cost you a
thousand more.”</p>

<p>The man laughed. But the laugh was harsh and
unconvincing in its lack of mirth.</p>

<p>“I like it in thousands,” he cried, as the girl’s chips
were slid into place to swell the pot. “There’s your
thousand and another. Well?”</p>

<p>There was a shuffling of feet amongst the spectators
and several coughed. It was an expression of the
wave of excitement surging.</p>

<p>“Perfectly well.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span></p>

<p>The girl matched his bet and raised it another hundred.
And the man laughed again with a further
challenge.</p>

<p>“It’ll cost you another thousand!” he cried, and his
tone was exulting.</p>

<p>Victor Burns found himself holding his breath while
he waited for the girl’s move. Just for one instant her
eyes flashed out of their usual calm. There was real
excitement in them now. And he wondered if at last
she had been caught out of her depth.</p>

<p>“And more,” she said. And her voice was perfectly
steady. “One thousand more.”</p>

<p>Her chips had become exhausted and she thrust forward
a roll of bills. Then she sat waiting for the man
to come again.</p>

<p>It was the supreme moment when the test of nerve
was at its highest pitch. The onlookers understood.
Big game as they were used to witnessing at this
centre table, it was the first time they had looked on
with stakes rising by a thousand dollars at a bet. The
question in every mind was the same. The man was
obviously a gold man with a pouch full of dust. What
was its limit? How far would he go under the influence
of the surroundings and the liquor he had obviously
consumed?</p>

<p>Cy Liskard clutched his cards and laughed harshly.</p>

<p>“Come again,” he shouted. “There’s your thousand
an’ another.”</p>

<p>He literally flung the bills on the table, for he, too,
had exhausted his chips. “Ther’s nigh fifteen thousand
in the pot. Can you see it an’ raise it? Raise it&mdash;if
you’ve the grit.”</p>

<p>“Sure, I will,” Claire replied with just a suspicion
of sharpness in her tone for all her smile. “Come<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
again, Mister man. Let’s see your colour. You
haven’t the stuff in you to raise that. It’ll cost you
fifteen hundred.”</p>

<p>The girl’s breath came quickly for all her self-control.
There was challenge in her tone, a woman’s
taunting. But to McLagan, who knew her every
mood, there was more. In his mind he questioned her
nerve if the man came back at her, and he edged his
way nearer, and his instinct was to support and
strengthen her in the weakness he fancied she was beginning
to betray.</p>

<p>He reached her side, and her opponent was forgotten.
Just for one instant her pretty eyes flashed a smiling
upward glance into his plain face, and a wave of relief
surged through his anxious mind. Her eyes were
full of the confident courage he had feared for.</p>

<p>“It’s good enough!”</p>

<p>Cy Liskard threw his cards on the table face downward.</p>

<p>“It’s yours, my lady. I’m done.”</p>

<p>A gasp of astonishment came from the onlookers.
The man’s defeat, his weakness, left them amazed.
Then, as Claire reached out and collected the pool,
short and sharp came Jubilee’s challenge.</p>

<p>“Your ‘openers,’ Mister!”</p>

<p>Cy Liskard turned his unsmiling eyes on the man.
His gaze was cold for all the harshness of his response.</p>

<p>“What the hell!” he cried.</p>

<p>Then he reached towards his cards and sought to
turn them. In doing so he displayed all five. Perhaps
it was intentional&mdash;perhaps, in a fury of resentment
at the challenge in his defeat, the thing was inadvertent.
Whatever it was, the revelation was complete
and a gasp of amazement greeted his action.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span></p>

<p>He had thrown in <em>four aces</em>!</p>

<p>A chorus of derision followed. There was laughter.
There were epithets of undisguised contempt for the
play that could yield four aces so tamely. Even
Claire smiled her contempt at her late opponent while
she thrust her own cards deeply into the remainder of
the pack. There was only the straight flush to have
beaten that hand, and the man had parted with something
like eight thousand dollars.</p>

<p>The comments of the onlookers remained unheeded.
The man’s dead eyes were on the woman opposite him.
He seemed oblivious to all but the smiling contempt in
her eyes.</p>

<p>“Say, ain’t you satisfied?” he demanded, a curious
note underlying the harshness of his tone.</p>

<p>Claire laughed derisively.</p>

<p>“Sure I am,” she cried. “I’m always satisfied with
easy money. Guess I’m ready to take all that’s coming,
even from a feller who’s fool enough to throw in
four aces. The deal’s with you, Jubilee.”</p>

<p>She turned to her grinning neighbour, who was shuffling
the cards, but the man at the end of the table
was not yet done with.</p>

<p>“Say,” he cried again, and his tone matched the
frigidity of his soulless eyes. “Ain’t ther’ no change
comin’? I handed you better than eight thousand dollars.
Guess you didn’t win that pool. I passed it you.
You didn’t bluff me a thing. Eight thousand couldn’t
scare a feller with my wad. No, sir. You’re queen
of this layout, and I don’t seem to yearn for any
lesser dame. You got eight thousand a present. An’
ther’s fi’ thousand more fer a dance. Guess that’s
what you’re here for, ain’t it? Here’s the stuff. I’m
out to buy. It’s right up to you. Well?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span></p>

<p>The coldness of it was icy. The brutal purpose
consummate. The man was in liquor, but it was no
drunken proposal. It was considered and confident.</p>

<p>A hot flush swept over the girl’s beautiful cheeks.
It dyed her fine brows right up to the roots of her no
less vivid hair. Then she smiled, and her eyes glittered.
She shook her head.</p>

<p>“You’re drunk or crazy,” she said. “I don’t know
where you come from. I don’t even know your name.
But I guess you best get back to the dirt you scratch
your gold out of. It’s the only place for men like
you.”</p>

<p>Claire spoke quietly, but there was that in her words
and tone that was indescribable in its utter contempt.
Cy Liskard withdrew the bunch of money he was
grasping with a jerk. He stood up. And his cold
gaze passed swiftly over the crowd of faces watching
the scene. Then his eyes came to rest again on the
beautiful creature he so obviously coveted, and dull
fury looked out of them.</p>

<p>“You b&mdash;&mdash;!”</p>

<p>But the filthy epithet was smothered. A man’s
great fist crashed it back into the foul throat that had
inspired it. Cy Liskard reeled. He fell backwards
against the chair from which he had arisen. And
when he recovered himself he was looking into the
muzzle of a heavy automatic pistol with the fierce,
narrow eyes of Ivor McLagan behind the weapon.</p>

<p>“You swine! Beat it! Beat it right out of here
or I’ll send you plumb to the hell you belong to! Push
up your hands, darn you! Push ’em up, an’ beat it!”</p>

<p>But the man made no attempt to obey. His pale
eyes stared back into the fury burning in the engineer’s.
His hands remained by his sides.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span></p>

<p>Those looking on realised the thing about to happen.
There was movement and scurrying as those in other
parts of the room scrambled out of the line of fire.
This stranger man was looking on death, calmly and
without yielding. Another moment and&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>But in that moment an amazing thing happened. It
almost seemed as if by magic the room had become
peopled by a small army of ghostly, white-robed figures.
They came in a sort of wave through the curtained
archway through which Claire, earlier in the evening,
had made her triumphal entry. And they swept down
upon the gold man from behind in the voiceless fashion
of avenging spectres.</p>

<p>It was all over in a moment. Cy Liskard was engulfed
in the white wave that rushed upon him. There
was a moment of confused, voiceless struggle. Then
the white-hooded spectres had vanished as they had
come and McLagan returned his heavy weapon to the
hip-pocket of the evening clothes he so cordially detested.</p>

<p>Cy Liskard had been spirited away by the white-clad
Aurora men, and almost on the instant the momentarily
interrupted game was resumed amidst a chorus of
laughter and eager comment. Nothing would be allowed
to interfere with the Speedway’s routine. Even
matters of life and death were of no real concern comparable
with the success of Max’s annual festival.</p>

<h2 class="no-brk p4"><span class="fs60"><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX"></a>CHAPTER IX</span><br /><br />

<span class="fs95">The Aurora Clan</span></h2>


<p class="drop-capy1">IT was brilliant moonlight. Millions of stars were
shining on the velvet of the heavenly dome, but
their sheen was dimmed against the vivid spread of
moving colour that lit the northern horizon. In the
cloudlessness of the night the mysterious blaze of the
Aurora had transformed the hours of darkness.</p>

<p>It was somewhere beyond the city limits where the
plain rose gently towards the distant, surrounding
hills, and the open gave place to wide bluffs of forest
land. The scene was set in a spacious clearing, with
a wealth of spruce and poplar and jack-pine rising out
of the tangle of undergrowth encompassing it. And
somewhere about its centre stood an aged Western
cedar, which looked to belong to other latitudes, other
climates.</p>

<p>The cedar was a forest giant of immense proportions.
It stood out in the splendid twilight black and overwhelming,
for all its height was dwarfed by the lofty,
tattered crowns of its aloofly respectful neighbours.
It formed a wide canopy of shelter beneath its far-reaching
boughs, matted with their manifold carpet
of curious foliage. It was a shelter admirably suited
to the ghostly scene being enacted beneath its shade.</p>

<p>Twenty white-robed, white-hooded figures stood in
an unbroken circle at a point where the wide-flung
boughs were at their greatest spread. Right above
them, almost exactly bisecting their circle, a monstrous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
bough reached out supporting a dangling, rawhide rope
which terminated in an ominous noose. Within a foot
of this noose, gazing squarely at it, bound hand and
foot, stood a white man prisoner.</p>

<p>For the moment complete silence prevailed while
Cy Liskard’s pale eyes surveyed the thing with which
he was confronted. He was sober enough now, and
there was no lack of understanding in him. He knew
he was the victim of no play game. For even he, comparative
stranger as he was to the life of Beacon Glory,
had heard of the doings of the men of the Aurora
Clan.</p>

<p>He had offended. He realised that. He had offended
these self-appointed custodians of the city’s
morals, and he was searching acutely the doubtful
chances confronting him.</p>

<p>His cold eyes passed over each silent figure in its
white cloth gown. He sought to penetrate the conical
hoods which enveloped each head, masking it completely
and falling generously upon the shoulders.
And all the time he was aware of the ugly thing which
hung precisely at the level of his neck.</p>

<p>The futility of his search quickly impressed itself
upon him. Bound fast, he was completely helpless.
These people had left him with sufficient freedom to
stand erect, but that was all. At length the silence, his
own impotence, and the hideous threat of the dangling
rope got the better of his none too generous stock of
self-restraint. He stirred, and sought to twist his
powerful arms free under their painful bonds. Then
of a sudden his voice rang out sharply, harshly, in a
characteristic challenge.</p>

<p>“Well? What the hell&mdash;next?”</p>

<p>There was fury in his challenge. There was a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
shadow of something else in its violence. And as the
sound of it died away the silence of the night came
back at him, filling him with a sense of his own utter
helplessness.</p>

<p>A few moments later one of the white figures stepped
out of its place in the circle. It came forward and
halted before the hanging rope. It raised its arms and
took possession of the noose, and when the rope was
finally released the captive realised that the noose had
been considerably widened.</p>

<p>Then the man stood a pace back and made a sign
with outstretched hands. He beckoned in two directions.
And, in a moment, the captive was seized from
behind and securely held by his bound arms.</p>

<p>Putting forth a tremendous effort, Cy Liskard
sought to free himself. It was quite hopeless; and the
effort, as a result of his bonds, only cost him his balance,
and, but for the support of his captors he would
have fallen to the ground.</p>

<p>The prisoner was no longer under any illusion. The
thing about to happen was obvious, and the silence of
it all suddenly drove panic surging. The man in front
of him had again possessed himself of the swinging
noose. He approached slowly. Then, in a moment,
the rope was placed over the prisoner’s head and
rested loosely upon his shoulders.</p>

<p>The figure withdrew at once to the tree-trunk. And
a moment later the noose drew sharply tight about Cy
Liskard’s bull-like neck.</p>

<p>With the tightening of the noose the last vestige of
the prisoner’s self-restraint vanished. He cried out,
and his whole impulse was for blasphemy and vituperation.</p>

<p>“Name of God!” he cried violently. “Cut this adrift<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
if you’re men and not swine. What have I done?
What d’you want? Gold? If you’re ‘hold-ups’ I’m
ready to pay. You’ve got me where you need me.
Turn loose your lousy tongues. If you cut this gear
adrift ther’ ain’t a man amongst you ’ud stand up to
me two seconds.”</p>

<p>A voice replied to him. It sounded muffled, and
hollow, and far-off as it came from behind the mask of
the man at the tree-trunk. But to the prisoner it came
in welcome relief. For it was the first human voice
he had heard since his capture.</p>

<p>“We want nothing from you, Cy Liskard,” it said.
“We aren’t out to rob dead men. You’re about to be
dealt with according to the laws of the Aurora Clan.”</p>

<p>The voice seemed to fade out rather than to cease
speaking. Then the controlling figure at the tree-trunk
gave a further sign. The two men standing ward of
their prisoner withdrew on the instant, and with a
jerk the rope tightened viciously about the prisoner’s
neck.</p>

<p>The man writhed under the sudden pressure. He
struggled fiercely. But every effort he made only
caused a further tightening of the rope. In panic and
complete and sudden despair, he ceased his struggles.
And on the instant the rope relaxed, and the muffled
voice came again.</p>

<p>“Your struggles are useless,” it said. “There’s no
escape from the Aurora Clan. Our men are everywhere
in the city, the valley, the forest, the plain. If
you broke from us now, you’d be recaptured within an
hour. Our purpose to-night is simple. To-night you
die&mdash;unless you swear never to return to Beacon Glory.
If you swear that you’ll be freed at once, and your
goods and ponies will be handed back to you here and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
now. There’s no alternative. No woman in Beacon
will ever be insulted by you again. We’ll see to that.
Remember, if you ever return to Beacon your death
will be instant. You can choose. You’ve two minutes
in which to do so.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The ballroom was a blaze of light. The raised
boxes about the walls were crowded with resting
couples refreshing themselves at the expense of their
host. The band, which was more brazen than seemed
necessary, was blaring out a fox-trot with a haunting
melody, which seemed to be the joy of the heart of
the uniformed man behind the slide trombone. The
softer strings were almost drowned under his super-human
efforts, and even the notes of the cornet were
hard put to it to obtain a hearing.</p>

<p>The dancers were many and various in their methods
and appearance. There were dress suits in evidence
among the men, and the women’s garments
ranged from prodigal scantiness to redundancy. There
were burly men and fat. There were lean creatures
who looked to spend their days on short rations and
hard work. While the women appeared, as they ever
do to the casual onlooker, a rainbow spectacle of femininity
pleasing enough to the masculine eye careless of
the details of their variegated costumes.</p>

<p>Doc Finch was among the stouter dancers and
his partner was only little less ample. They looked
comfortably hot and in no danger of foot entanglement.
Jubilee was striding vigorously with a good-looking
woman whose beauty owed much to her gown
and the careful application of facial make-up. Bad
Booker was smiling over the shoulder of a young
thing who was frankly absorbed in the joys of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
dance without regard for the company she was keeping.
While Jake Forner, his chief clerk, was straining
every nerve to keep pace with a woman whose
efforts suggested gymnasium training rather than
terpsichorean. He was perspiring freely, and a far-off
look of troubled concentration gazed out of his
student’s eyes, leaving it a matter for speculation as
to when the breaking point would be reached.</p>

<p>It was a scene of real and comparatively decent
human revelry. Outwardly, at least, its decorum was
complete. The night was still young enough for the
human nature gathered there to retain possession
of the cloak of seeming which the occasion imposed.
It was a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bal masque</i> without its phantasy of costume.</p>

<p>Claire Carver and Ivor McLagan were in possession
of one of the boxes. The waiter had just deposited
a tray of refreshments on the table between
them. True to her fixed rule the girl had ordered
coffee and a savoury sandwich. But the oil man had
no such scruples. His refreshment was a Rye highball.</p>

<p>Claire had abandoned her game immediately after
the discomfiture of the stranger gold man. The thing
had startled her out of her usual equanimity. Trouble
of one sort or another was by no means new to her.
But in her eight months of the life of the Speedway
it had been the first time she, herself, had been
subjected to downright insult. She had always understood
the risk she ran. Her mother and friends
were always behind her ready to remind her if in
her more generous moments of happy optimism she
should chance to forget. But for all that the shock
had been no less, and for once she had been glad<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
enough to accept the company of the man who had
so promptly defended her, and turn her back on the
shrine of the temple at which she worshipped.</p>

<p>McLagan read through the mask of levity she was
endeavouring to impose upon herself. Out of his love
and great sympathy his pity had promptly leapt. It
stirred him to her further aid. And so he had gladly
availed himself of the mood that had made her laughingly
appeal to him for the dance she had refused to
the man who had so grossly enriched her.</p>

<p>They were talking now as they rested, watching the
antics of the buoyant crowd moving rhythmically to
the brazen efforts of the band.</p>

<p>“You know, Ivor,” Claire said smiling but reflectively,
“those white fixed folk get me scared to death.
It’s the first time I’ve seen them close up. Once before
I saw them, or thought I did. I was out in the
automobile, and I kind of thought I saw a bunch of
them move off the trail ahead of me in the dusk and
hide up in the bush. I wasn’t sure, but I was scared
enough then. It’s queer. How&mdash;how did they know
to-night? How did they come along right on time?
was it Max on the ’phone? I didn’t see Max around
at all. Say, does he run them? Are they sort of his
police? They scare me. I was glad enough to see them
get around. You see, that feller didn’t put his hands
up to you when you had him covered. But I sort of
feel we don’t just know where we are with such a
gang operating.”</p>

<p>The girl was gazing down on the moving crowd
while she voiced her apprehensions, and the man was
left free to feast his eyes on the picture she made in
her beautiful gown and the hat that was so perfect
a crown to the wealth of vivid hair beneath it. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
was smiling happily in the reward her presence bestowed
upon him for his efforts in her defence.</p>

<p>“It’s kind of queer, Claire,” he said, and there was
that curious harshness of tone which he rarely seemed
able to avoid. “But some way I don’t feel it’s for
you to be scared a thing. If this gang is what it’s
reputed I’d say it’s only the folks with unclean minds
and ways that need to be scared. But there certainly
are things calculated to set folks worrying the way
the Clan learns and acts when things are wrong. I
don’t reckon Max has a thing to do with ’em. Though
you never can tell. I was talking to Max when we
came down. I allow he’s quite an actor. But&mdash;well,
if he was acting it was mighty clever. He was raising
hell to learn how those folks got in on his precious
Speedway.”</p>

<p>The girl turned from the scene that so entertained
her.</p>

<p>“Was he?” She shook her head. “He’s got a head
as long as&mdash;as the body of that girl dancing with
Burt down there,” she said with a laugh. “He’s not
going to give himself away. I’d say he’s a great bluff
when he feels like it. You know I’ll have to quit the
Speedway or&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Or what?”</p>

<p>McLagan’s eyes were no longer smiling.</p>

<p>“Or marry him.”</p>

<p>The girl’s smile had passed. Her eyes were no less
serious than his.</p>

<p>“You mean that?”</p>

<p>McLagan was leaning across the table with his
hands supporting his plain face. He waited while
Claire sipped her coffee and nodded over her cup.
Then he went on deliberately and almost harshly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span></p>

<p>“You can’t! You mustn’t! You shan’t!”</p>

<p>He was stirred out of his usual calm. And Claire’s
gaze lowered before the hot fire she beheld leap into
his eyes.</p>

<p>“He’s wealthy,” she said slily.</p>

<p>“And he’s like a tame cat. The creature you hate.”</p>

<p>Claire set her cup down and laughed happily.</p>

<p>“That’s no argument,” she cried.</p>

<p>“Argument?” McLagan shook his head. Then he
added significantly: “If you want argument I can give
it you.”</p>

<p>“Not that sort,” Claire warned him sharply. “I
have your promise. But I’d like to hear any other&mdash;from
you.”</p>

<p>The man sat up. He leant back in his chair and
gulped down half his highball. His moment of unrestraint
had passed. He was smiling again, but a
feeling something approaching bitterness laid hold of
him that Claire would tolerate only his friendliness.
He gazed into her face and smiled. But he was
yearning with a passion that well nigh devastated his
sternly controlled composure. He shook his head.</p>

<p>“No, Claire. You mustn’t marry Max,” he said.
“You know him as the actor he is. I know him as
he really is.” He leant over the table again. “Say,
I wouldn’t marry a she-wolf to Max.”</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>McLagan shrugged.</p>

<p>“Leave it at that,” he said brusquely. “Here, kid,”
he went on quickly. “You’re right. You must quit
the Speedway. Quit it all. It’s not for you. Don’t
you see? Oh, yes! I know. The folks are good to
you. Sure they are. They’re mostly men, and you’re
a swell girl that sets them crazy to be good to you.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
But it’s all on the top. There isn’t a thing underneath
but the ordinary muck of human nature.
You’re going to get it sometime when I’m not around,
if you keep on. And there’s sure no need for you
to keep on. I&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“But there is.” Claire’s interruption came sharply,
and she held up a warning finger at the threat of
storm she again read in the man’s hot eyes. “Here,
Ivor. I said plain argument. Listen. I’m making
money in bunches. Big bunches. I need the money.
And I love the game. But some day I’ll need to quit.
I know that. But it won’t be till my luck breaks, or&mdash;Max
turns. If Max turns first I’ll need to get out
quick. No! I’ll never marry Max! I’d sooner
marry&mdash;Satan. Oh, yes! When that happens I’ll get
out quick. I know. I’m wise. You don’t need to
be scared for me. But meanwhile I go right on&mdash;&mdash;
Hello! Say&mdash;look!”</p>

<p>The girl was pointing down the ballroom. Her
eyes had widened. They were sparkling with a queer
light.</p>

<p>McLagan was leaning forward. He was following
the direction of the pointing finger, peering out half
hidden behind the curtain hangings. And as he gazed
upon the queer scene that had startled his companion
the braying of the band crashed awkwardly into complete
silence, and the dancing floor was cleared as if
by magic.</p>

<p>Three white-robed figures were making their way
in silent procession down the length of the room.
They moved slowly, and with monkish dignity, their
high-pointed mask hoods, with their goggling eyeholes,
creating an atmosphere that hushed the onlookers to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
dead silence. Behind them the arched entrance was
crowded with similar ghostly figures. But the illusion
in this direction was largely counteracted by the array
of heavy guns held ready for prompt action by hands
all sufficiently human.</p>

<p>It was a tense moment. The silence was deathly.
Only the sound of the footsteps of the moving figures
broke it. The whole company was shocked to impotence.
And the eyes of all were preoccupied between
the array of arms in the far archway and the
progress of the moving trio. The “hold-up” was complete.</p>

<p>The three figures halted before the buttress pillar
which centred one of the walls, and on which was
fixed the notice-board whereon was pinned the dance
programme for the night. They gathered about it,
and for some moments their movements clearly told
of their purpose. Then they moved away, returning
as they had come, without haste and without a word.
Again they passed over the polished floor. They
reached the archway and their supporters. They
passed through the closed ranks. Then, in a moment,
the whole of the silent white army had withdrawn
as abruptly as it had appeared.</p>

<p>A rush, a scramble followed. Men and women,
even the orchestra men, hurried over to the notice-board.
The dance programme was lying on the floor
below it and its place had been usurped by a large
sheet of paper covering the whole extent of the board.</p>

<p>McLagan and Claire had abandoned their box and
joined the curious crowd. They were standing on the
fringe of it, gazing at the white sheet of paper bearing
its written notice in crude, hand-printed lettering.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
There was no need to get nearer. The text was plain
enough and large enough to be read from across the
room.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="center">
TAKE NOTICE<br />
</p>

<p>The people of Beacon Glory are warned that the presence
of one, Cy Liskard, on the premises of the Speedway will
be the signal for its complete destruction by fire.</p>

<p class="right">
Sgd. <span class="smcap">Chief Light of the Aurora</span>.<br />
</p></div>

<p>Claire turned to the man at her side.</p>

<p>“Max isn’t around,” she said significantly.</p>

<p>McLagan shook his head.</p>

<p>“He’ll be along,” he said, and glanced expectantly
in the direction of the arched doorway.</p>

<p>The crowd was recovering itself. It was moving
away, and comment and laughter made themselves
heard in every direction. The bandsmen were hurrying
back to their dais where the conductor was summoning
them with sharp taps of his baton on his music
stand. The boxes, too, were rapidly refilling. Doctor
Finch approached McLagan and Claire. He
laughed with a little uncertainty.</p>

<p>“Things are kind of busy,” he said. “Max’ll need
to have a sharp eye. These boys don’t bluff any.”</p>

<p>McLagan shook his head.</p>

<p>“No,” he admitted seriously. “They don’t bluff.
If that boy shows up inside the Speedway I wouldn’t
give five cents for Max’s fire policy.”</p>

<p>Claire looked round quickly. The band had just
started a One-step. She had been interestedly watching
the entrance.</p>

<p>“Let’s dance, Ivor,” she said quietly. “Max has
just come in.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span></p>

<p>McLagan glanced round quickly. Max, dark, sleek,
picturesque, was coming towards them hurrying down
the room. His face was unsmiling, and to those who
knew him the signs were sufficiently ominous.</p>

<p>McLagan quickly took possession of the girl and
drew her away from the region of the notice-board
and Max, and as the latter came up and stood himself
before the insolent threat it contained, he found
himself alone with such emotions as the message inspired.
Claire and McLagan, like the rest of the
dancers, were observing him half-amusedly, half-doubtfully
as they glided about over the polished floor
which was so much his pride. They knew that his
wealth and power as the reigning monarch of his
beloved Speedway had been challenged, and they wondered
as to its possible effect upon a man of his temperament.</p>

<span class="fs95">The Haunt of the Clansmen</span></h2>


<p class="drop-capy1">FOR all the glory of the night had waned, lost in
the deeper shadows of the hour before dawn, the
house stood out stark and decaying on the low foreshore
of the lake. Once upon a time the place had
represented luxury. It had possessed an enclosure
where its owner had sought to cultivate a flower garden
about it. There had also been a pile-built landing
at the water’s edge, and a stout boat house. There
had even been a roadway approach from the city
which was more than a mile distant. But, like the
house itself, these things had long since yielded to
the fierce battle of the elements. A few up-standing
timber-baulks reared their rotting heads above the
water. The original fencing of the enclosure lay rotting
on the ground, and the roadway to the city was
almost completely submerged by the encroaching
waters. For the most part the house was well-nigh
roofless. The shingles had been torn from their
places, and the underlying joists stood out bare to
the storms which swept the plain in the howling winter
season.</p>

<p>It was a relic of the vaunting days of the boom
of Beacon Glory when easy money so often robbed
even the astuter souls of that longer vision of which
they stood in so much need. It had doubtless been
the pride of some more than usually fortunate creature’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
heart, who yearned to possess a lake-side summer
residence. There were many signs about it to
give such an impression. There were the remains of
the deep-roofed stoop for lounging in the sweltering
heat of summer. There were the French casement
window frames overlooking the lake. Then the woodwork
and the joinery were of the finest quality, while
the whole planning suggested a type so beloved of
the heart of New England.</p>

<p>But now, with the waters of the lake lapping about
the foundations of the verandah, with the garden and
the roadway approach a partly submerged wilderness,
in the chill windlessness of the last of the night, the
place only added to the general impression of distance
and darkness and utter desolation.</p>

<p>The moon had lost its cold brilliance. It lay fallen
from its high estate in the dome of the heavens, lolling
wearily, a dull yellow disc just above the horizon. The
stars, too, had yielded their twinkling brightness, while
the cold fires of the Aurora were burning low, and
their ceaseless movement suggested a hasty, disorderly
retreat to the mysterious fastnesses of the northern
world which had given them birth.</p>

<p>Yet life was stirring, and it centred about this derelict
habitation.</p>

<p>Two men had passed the rotting fencing and made
their way through the tangle of growth to the back
entrance, which clearly opened into the kitchen premises.
They paused before the closed door and remained
talking in low tones for some moments, then
one of them, a man of big physique, raised a clenched
hand and his knuckles rapped sharply and peculiarly
on the resounding woodwork. There was a further
moment of delay, then the door swung open inwards,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
and the darkness beyond swallowed up the newly
arrived visitors.</p>

<p>After awhile there came a further arrival. He was
a stoutish creature who gazed searchingly about him
in the darkness before passing on beyond the line of
the containing fence. But finally he, too, passed from
view as had the earlier comers, and the engulfing solitude
in which the derelict habitation was wrapped returned
to its unbroken sway.</p>

<p>After that, in quick succession, there were two further
arrivals. They came, both of them, from the
direction of the sleeping city. They came singly, and
in each case their approach was in similar method to
those who came before. It was as if rule governed
them, they approached cautiously, peering and listening
in the dim twilight of the night. Then came the
signal knock upon the door, and after that the gaping
darkness of the interior swallowed them up in the
voiceless mechanical fashion which suggested a contrivance
controlled from somewhere in the far interior
of the deserted habitation.</p>

<p>As the last of the five visitors passed into the house
there came the sound of the bolting and barring of
the entrance door, and the final operation was completed
just as the first streak of dawn transformed the
eastern horizon, and brought forth the waking chorus
of the wild fowl upon the lake.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The room was bare of all ordinary furnishings.
The brick walls were cracked and decayed and discoloured
with damp patches. It was a windowless
apartment containing the rusted boiler and gear of a
steam-heat furnace. In one corner lay a small quantity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
of anthracite coal and a rusted shovel, and the
concrete floor of the place was a-litter with rubbish
and damp patches, and odds and ends of old packing-cases
clearly left there for the original purpose of
kindling.</p>

<p>The place was lit by an oil lamp suspended on a
hook in one of the timber joists supporting the floor
of the house above, and by its dim, yellow light four
white-robed figures, with their sugar-loaf hoods,
pierced with eye-holes, were revealed lounging on
such of the upturned packing-cases as afforded reasonable
security. A fifth was standing, leaning in his
immaculate garment against the rusted side of the
derelict furnace.</p>

<p>It was a spectacle for humour to witness these
queer, ghostly figures in their secret haunt, holding
solemn conclave in a cellar which in ordinary life
probably nothing on earth would have induced any of
them to enter. But their purpose was utterly and
completely serious. They formed the Supreme Executive
of the “Council of the Northern Lights,” which
was the whole control of the great body of the men
of the Aurora Clan.</p>

<p>The big man at the furnace was clearly the leader
and prime moving spirit of the organisation, and he
was talking in the cold, hard fashion which so much
suggested his position. His whole manner was that
of keen command, but for all the coldness of his tone
there was neither roughness of language nor the least
vaunting display of authority.</p>

<p>“We needed this council right away,” he said. “We
need to take a clear decision before the sun gets up.
That’s why I sent you boys word when maybe you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
were yearning to make good the sleep you’re needing.
We’ve had a busy night. And I reckon, as a result
of it, we’ve a busy time in the future.”</p>

<p>He paused. His hooded head was raised so that
its eye-holes were directed at the lantern above him,
which had begun to splutter. As the flame settled
again to its business he went on:</p>

<p>“Our job is primarily to clean up some of the muck
lying about our city. I know that. But I never had
any doubts, from the moment of our foundation, that
an endeavour like ours might easily lead us into other
work&mdash;other responsibilities. The logic of the whole
position is simple. If we reckon to clean up the muck
of the city, we also need to set its furniture into decent
order. It’s no use setting hogs to live in a
palace. If we’re cleaning up morals, let’s look to
folks’ rights.”</p>

<p>He paused again. This time he was listening
acutely. There was a sound drifting somewhere out
over the bosom of the lake. It was the rising of the
wind as the sun approached the horizon.</p>

<p>“Now, boys,” he went on, speaking more hastily,
“I don’t want to keep you from the sleep you’re all
needing, but this is the proposition as a result of this
night’s work. Beacon stands right at the crossways
to-day. Maybe soon there’ll be a flood of oil come
to its rescue through those folks on the Alsek River.
That, I guess, is in the lap of the gods and the feller
running it. Then there’s the other thing&mdash;gold. It
was gold that raised this city. Well, Beacon can go
up, or further down, as a result of those two things.
A big gold strike or a big oil strike, can send her
sky high. That’s all right. But it seems to me our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
work demands that whether it’s the feller, McLagan,
with his oil, or any other boy with gold, we need to
see that Beacon gets its due success as a result of any
strike in its neighbourhood. I guess McLagan’ll play
white. If he don’t the remedy is with our Clan. But
the gold boys are more difficult.”</p>

<p>He stood up from the rusty stove, and his white
robe was sadly besmirched, but he gave no heed and
went on sharply and with obvious feeling.</p>

<p>“It’s that feller, Cy Liskard, we’ve been dealing
with to-night. I believe he’s made a strike that looks
like transforming Beacon from a derelict city to a
hive of prosperity.”</p>

<p>There was a movement amongst his audience which
clearly displayed the impression, the effect of the
magic of gold upon these men of the gold city. A
voice came back at him out of one of the hoods.</p>

<p>“He comes from the Lias River.”</p>

<p>“I’ve heard that, too.”</p>

<p>“An’ the Lias River runs right back into the mountains,
hundreds of miles,” said the same voice.</p>

<p>“Sure.” The man at the stove nodded his cowled
head. “That’s so. It runs right back into Canadian
territory. If that feller has made a big strike, and
I know he has, Beacon should know it. No feller’s
entitled to more than his claim. Beacon should know
the place. Beacon should have a right to jump in,
too. There’s decent men and women with as much
right as Cy Liskard, and maybe more, to handle the
wealth of this territory, and it’s up to us to hand them
the chance. We ask ’em to live clean and wholesome.
Well, we’ve the right to show ’em how, and help ’em.
We must send a bunch to the Lias River and locate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
this strike. We must respect Liskard’s claim, whether
it’s in Alaskan or Canadian Territory, but we want its
secret for the folks of Beacon. Well?”</p>

<p>Discussion followed promptly. It came in the
quick, hot fashion of men whose main outlook on
life is bounded by the precious metal that first brought
their city into being. And the discussion tended to
complete agreement with the man whose guidance they
had accepted.</p>

<p>The leader listened closely to every argument his
council put forth. He agreed to, or negatived, each
argument with calm impartiality, and when, at last,
nothing further was forthcoming from his Counsellors,
he leant again against his supporting stove, and raised
up one warning hand in sign that the debate was
finished.</p>

<p>“I put the proposition,” he said formally, “we appoint
a bunch of the boys to investigate on the lines
we’ve laid down. There must be no other action
taken. The man must be shadowed to his destination.
His movements must be watched, and when the
discovery is complete, or sufficient has been ascertained
of the whereabouts of his strike, full report must be
made to this council. Then we will decide on procedure.
There are gold men amongst us, but our oath
must prevail. The result of this investigation is for
the community of Beacon Glory, regardless of all individual
personal interests. Is it agreed?”</p>

<p>The prompt show of hands was unanimous. Finally
the “Chief Light of the Aurora” himself raised his
right hand.</p>

<p>One by one the hands were lowered and the leader
spoke again:</p>

<p>“It’s sufficient. The investigators will set out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
forthwith. We shall need a competent leader for the
work. Therefore, I call on you, Number Three,” he
said, pointing at the stoutish figure sitting third
amongst his audience. “You are best qualified in every
way. You have years of the gold trail behind you,
and you will know how best to deal with any opposition
you may encounter from this man. The meeting
is closed.”</p>

<p>He reached up and unhooked the lantern in the
roof. The next moment the cellar was in complete
darkness.</p>

<span class="fs95">The Wreck at the River Mouth</span></h2>


<p class="drop-capy1">SASA MANNIK was down at the seashore. He
was labouring over his fishing tackle, which was
only little less primitive than that of his Eskimo fore-bears.
His sturdy bluff-nosed, sea-going boat was
lying nearby on the shelving beach, awaiting the moment
when she would be run down into the racing
waters waiting to receive it. The man was a half-breed
Eskimo, in whom White and Indian ran a neck-and-neck
race with the original stock from which he
sprang.</p>

<p>Sasa was a characteristic creature. In build he was
squat, and of enormous physical strength. He had
a beardless face that might have belonged to almost
any native race. His eyes were mere deeply set slits;
his mouth was large and loose; his nose was as flat
and broad as his cheekbones were high and prominent;
while his lank black hair suggested nothing so
much as a horse’s mane. He was certainly unprepossessing
and even crafty to look at, but he was by no
means without many redeeming qualities. He was a
fisherman first and before everything, but he was a
reasonably faithful servant, <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Period added after 'faithful servant, too'">too</ins>. His greatest weakness,
however, was an addiction to a picturesque and
superstitious lying which Ivor McLagan, who employed
him, chose to condone for the sake of his
otherwise useful service. The engineer liked the man.
Sasa made a curious appeal to him. And so he paid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
him ten dollars a month, and permitted him to cook,
and wash, and look after the log shanty, which, like
an eyrie, he had set up on the high cliffs overlooking
the mouth of the Alsek River.</p>

<p>It was a no less bleak and desolate inlet than a
hundred others which serrated the southern coast line
of Alaska. Attacked from sea and land, a way had
been driven through the granite cliffs so that river
and sea merged in an iron-bound bay, sea-bird haunted
and without a vestige of softening from its barren
austerity. Its waters were set with numberless upstanding
granite fangs, and the swirl of its turbulent
tide revealed submerged traps in almost any direction.
The bay possessed two definite, comparatively free
and wide channels. One travelled southwards while
the other hugged tightly to the northern shore. But
even in these the racing tide looked ready to crash
the adventurous navigator upon unguessed disasters.</p>

<p>Sasa Mannik stood up from his labours and his
narrowed eyes gazed contemplatively out over the racing
waters. He, like his employer, saw none of the
natural terrors with which their high-perched home
was surrounded. Ivor McLagan had no business with
the hauntings and dread which Nature strives to inspire
in her harsher moments. His was the hard,
practical, hungry mind of one of the earth’s seekers.
His only care was for the lure of the business which
was his. His home had been pitched in the heart of
this natural wilderness, that, in his brief moments of
rest from the labours of his enterprise farther up the
river, he might look out on the wide-open sea. Whatever
the storms that howled about his staunch homestead
there were always hope, and health, and sunlight
in the breath of the restless ocean.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span></p>

<p>Sasa was quite without any concern in the matter
of where his existence was set, provided the sea was
within his reach. If his boss chose to live like some
foolish sea-fowl, perched on the summit of barren
cliffs, that was his affair. For himself he would undoubtedly
have chosen some sheltered bluff on the
river where the worst storm would be powerless to fan
the flame of his camp-fire. But then he was not a
white man and foolish. So he contented himself with
things as they were, and fished, and traded his catch
at his leisure, and carefully pouched the money he so
earned. And meanwhile he ate and drank well at his
boss’s expense, and fulfilled as much of his side of
the contract between them as suited him.</p>

<p>The man’s eyes looked to be almost tight shut as
he searched the swirl of waters sweeping by, and the
cloud-flecked sky above them. All his experience was
in full play at the back of his mind. It was a fresh
spring day, and the waters were smiling as much as
they ever permitted themselves to smile, and the restless
gulls were winging in every direction accompanying
their efforts with mournful cries of joy. A light
breeze was coming out of the northwest.</p>

<p>In Sasa’s mind the indications were not all that he
might have desired. The northwest wind was always
something that could leap suddenly into a howling
gale. But then, on the other hand, it was good for
the salmon shoals, which at no time of the year he
had any scruple about attacking. Yes. On the whole
the day was too good to miss. Besides, the risk of
a sudden gale added spice to his labours. His boat
was stout. It was ready. So was his gear. Then,
too, there were many shelters on that broken coast
he knew of in case of need.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span></p>

<p>He turned his dark face to windwards, where a
sharp and lofty headland shut out something of his
view. His movement possessed no real inspiration.
It was the mechanical result of his thought. This
way lay the northern channel which surged round the
rugged beach at the foot of the headland. He had
no thought of passing out that way. It would be
simple madness to make the attempt. Besides, it
would be impossible. No boat could face the torrential
rush of the current in that direction. He knew
it as the “Channel of Death.”</p>

<p>Not even a crazy white man with his boat of iron
and smoke could face that channel and hope to reach
the sea. But the current had its uses for a real sailorman
like himself. Oh, yes. A hundred times he
had sailed home to this beach upon it. And even to
do that was an adventure that stirred his native vanity
and yielded him vaunting satisfaction in his own skill.
No. He would run down on the southern channel.
He would fish with the ebb till it was nearing flat
water, then he would beat up northward and sail home
down the northerly raceway with a free wind. That
is, if no gale arose to&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>His train of thought suddenly broke off short.
Something had caught and held his whole attention
out there somewhere beyond the sharp-cut headland.
And as he gazed, his eyes screwed up in the brilliant
sunshine, he drew a sharp breath which was his only
expression of astonished incredulity. Just for one
brief moment he stood thus. Then he suddenly set
off at a run, making all speed for the fierce beach
where the ocean rollers roared impotently at the foot
of the headland.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>More than a month had passed since the night of
the Speedway’s festival. It had been a time of intensive
work for the head of the Mountain Oil Corporation.
The summer was short, all too short, for
the work he was engaged upon, and of necessity he
was forced to drive hard while the season permitted.
Now he was at home drafting an earlier survey of a
territory which looked like revolutionizing the work
of his company.</p>

<p>In the midst of his labours he looked up as the
door of his log shanty was unceremoniously thrust
open.</p>

<p>The table before which he was seated was a rough
enough piece of furniture, as were most of the fitments
of this shelter he had set up on the wind-swept cliffs.
It was littered with the mechanical drawings, and
charts, and maps he was at work upon. There was a
queer assemblage, too, of the instruments of his profession
lying scattered over the completely untidy
apartment.</p>

<p>Peter Loby stood regarding him with a smiling look
of relief.</p>

<p>“I’m glad I took the chance, boss,” he said, with a
laugh of content. “Guess I was two minds about it.
You see, I came down the river because I wanted to
save you the trip up&mdash;an’ to gain time.”</p>

<p>“Why? What’s doing, Peter?”</p>

<p>McLagan spoke quietly, but his eyes were sharply
questioning.</p>

<p>Peter was a tall, lean creature whose whole horizon
was bounded by oil and the business of extracting it
from the bosom of mother earth. He was a practical
expert to his finger tips. But he possessed no knowledge
beyond its sheerly technical side. He was glad<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
enough to serve under McLagan. He knew his chief’s
worth as a dogged, fighting, companionable creature
who held his place as the principal representative of
the world’s greatest oil concern by sheer ability. And
he knew his own expertness would have full play
under McLagan’s control, and such reward on results
would come his way as rarely enough fall to the man
in his position. Furthermore, he liked the man, and
desired nothing better than to serve as his foreman
of works.</p>

<p>“Why, I spent three weeks on that coal belt you
located last fall. An’ I’ve made a further rough map
of the thing you guessed about it but didn’t figger to
chase up at the time. Here’s the map. Maybe you
best read it. I’ll talk after.”</p>

<p>He passed a large linen tracing across to the man
behind the table, and drew out a plug of chewing
tobacco from the hip pocket of his moleskin trousers.
Then he propped himself against the doorcasing and
gazed out seaward, while his lean jaws masticated the
chew he had bitten off.</p>

<p>After awhile McLagan looked up from the carefully
drawn chart.</p>

<p>“That belt passes right back into Canadian territory,”
he said.</p>

<p>Peter turned.</p>

<p>“Sure, boss,” he replied, with a light of triumph in
his keen eyes. “But there’s more than that to it. A
heap more. That’s why I got around on the dead
jump.”</p>

<p>He stood up from his leaning attitude and his hands
were spread out in an expressive gesture. The man
was simply bursting with his news.</p>

<p>“It looks to me we’re in the heart of the world’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
biggest coal beds, an’ the signs are we’re surely right
on the fringe of the oil field that’s mixed up with it,”
he went on. He came over and rested his hands on
the table, leaning forward the more surely to impress
the man behind it. “I tell you, boss, right here we’ve
hit the biggest cinch since the world began. We’re
on oil now, and drilling through hard black lime.
That’s all right. But further back is where the real
stuff lies, an’ it’s right in the heart of such a coal
belt as I’ve only dreamed about. It’s a range of coal
mountains. It’s nothing less. And the valleys are
the natural drainways for the thick juicy oil we’re
yearning to tap. It’s that brought me along. I want
to take you right up there to see the thing it is. But
I’m crazy for you to wire this report I’ve got here,
from Beacon to our folks down home. Here it is,
boss,” he went on urgently, as he drew a folded sheet
from an inside pocket. “I wanted you to get that,
an’ send it from Beacon first, an’ then come right
along up where I can show you oil lying around where
ther’ ought to be only creeks of mountain water.”</p>

<p>The man was wellnigh beside himself with excitement.
Oil was his job. Oil was his whole life. And
out of his experience and keen practical knowledge, he
knew he had jumped into the heart of such an El
Dorado as he had only found hitherto in his dreams.</p>

<p>But McLagan refused to be caught up by the infection
of the man’s excitement. It was not that he
doubted. He never doubted when Peter Loby gave
his considered opinion on such a subject. But he knew
the amazing nature of the man’s assertion, and he knew
that never before had he experienced a moment when
calm judgment was more surely needed.</p>

<p>He read the written report. Then he looked up at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
the man who still stood leaning over the table awaiting
his decision. He nodded.</p>

<p>“If this is right, Peter, it’s&mdash;the biggest thing in the
world,” he said.</p>

<p>His eyes were shining.</p>

<p>“It’s right, boss. You’ll pass that on?”</p>

<p>McLagan shook his head.</p>

<p>“It’s too&mdash;big&mdash;as it is,” he said. “Too sweeping.
I’ll rewrite it, and let you see what I’ll send. I just
daren’t send it all till we’ve tried it out. I’m glad you
came along down, Peter.”</p>

<p>He held out a hand and the oil man gripped it.</p>

<p>“Act the way you think, boss,” the man said, but
with a shadow of disappointment. “You know best.
Say&mdash;it’s great.”</p>

<p>“It surely is. After this I guess you’ll be able to
quit the game and sit back&mdash;Hello!”</p>

<p>Sasa Mannik’s stocky body was filling up the open
doorway. He stood there breathlessly gesticulating.</p>

<p>“Boss! Boss! You come quick!” he cried. “It
dam’ fool white man with big ship, plenty much sail.
Him come along by raceway tide. Him break all up
sure. All no good break up. You come quick. Crazy
white man. All dam’ fool. No good.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The three men were standing outside the hut perched
so perilously near to the sharp-cut edge of the sheer
cliff. They were standing at an altitude of something
over four hundred feet, gazing over the wild scene of
the bay. It was the highest point immediately overlooking
the mouth of the Alsek River.</p>

<p>Behind them, to the north and to the south, rose the
great hills which had remained snow-clad throughout
the ages. But there the iron cliffs of the coast line<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
stretched out at something like a uniform level. Far
as the eye could see the smiling ocean lay spread out,
glittering under the keen spring sunshine, while below
them, marked clearly, sharply, lay the ugly ruins of
torn rock which the storms of centuries had hewn from
the parent cliffs.</p>

<p>It was a scene these men knew by heart. All three
were gazing out seawards. Their eyes were fixed
upon a vessel that looked to be driving head on, under
full sail, for the merciless rocks guarding the entrance
to the river mouth.</p>

<p>It was a sight that stirred the white men deeply. It
was a sight that filled them with a strangely oppressive
feeling of complete helplessness, and left them no
longer concerned with those things which a moment
before had completely preoccupied them. Here, on a
calm Spring day, with a seemingly flat sea, a white
man’s vessel under full sail&mdash;no wreck, no derelict with
broken masts and spars, and with perhaps the steering-gear
carried away&mdash;was heading calmly, almost it
seemed, happily, to become a total wreck on perhaps
the cruellest coast in the world. It was amazing! It
was staggering! The awesomeness of the spectacle
left them without a word.</p>

<p>Not so, however, the half-breed who had brought
the news. Perhaps he was less stirred by such a vision
of coming disaster. Perhaps, in his curious, savage
mind, the life or death of a few crazy white-folk was
of no serious account. At any rate, he was under no
spell of silent awe.</p>

<p>“It all same lak I see this white man do all time,” he
commented for his companions’ benefit. “What you
mak? I tell you this. White man sailor see big bay.
He see it all through much long glass. He say, ‘Yes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
it good. We mak him land.’ He not think nothing.
He not think ever. He white man. He do as he
please. Yes. It same all time. White man boss look
for oil. He say, ‘We find him.’ So he look where
only hill, an’ forest, an’ river. He look for oil. Psha!
I see white man down the coast same lak this, too.
He come down in big canoe. He look, look all time
for some thing. I not know. He search much. He
climb rock. He peek in cave. All time he look where
nothing is. That white man, sure. All time look
where nothing is. I know. This man sailor. He
mak break up all bimeby. He look for some thing. So
he come. He sure find something bimeby. Plenty
rock. Plenty all break up. Plenty all go dead.”</p>

<p>“Oh, beat it!”</p>

<p>It was Peter who flung his impatience at the half-breed.
His chatter at such a moment was insufferable.
Out there far beyond the headland the vessel was
steadily heading on its course. It was racing down
out of the northwest straight, almost as an arrow’s
flight, for the desperate entrance to the bay.</p>

<p>McLagan remained silent. He seemed oblivious to
everything but the amazing vision of the doomed ship.
His narrowed eyes searched her closely. She was
smallish, as sea-going vessels went. He gathered from
her sails and masts she was some sort of full-rigged
ship, perhaps a coaster. Her sails were full in the fair
wind. She was yawing slightly, but not sufficiently
to set her aback. But it was sufficient to suggest some
lack of control. Suddenly an inspiration took hold of
him. He turned to the now silent half-breed.</p>

<p>“You, Sasa,” he said sharply. “It was blowing yesterday
an’ you didn’t go out poaching the salmon.
That poor devil of a ship’s caught in your death current.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
She’s made a lee shore and got caught in the
current. She’ll pull up right on the beach of our
river, do you understand? He’s no fool skipper looking
to make a landing. He can’t darn well help himself.
Don’t you see? Here, Peter.” He turned to
the oil man on the other side of him and his tone was
urgent and thrilling with the horror of the thing he
realised was about to happen. “You don’t know this
coast like we do. There’s a maelstrom current out
there. The only crazy man in the world who’d go
near it is this feller, Sasa. Ther’ isn’t a steamer in the
world could beat its way out of it if it once got caught
up in it. As for a windjammer like that&mdash;psha!” he
threw up his hands expressively. “That’s it. He’s
made a lee shore in the gale. And now&mdash;God help
him.”</p>

<p>He turned again to Sasa.</p>

<p>“Where’ll he beach?” he asked sharply.</p>

<p>The half-breed pointed down at the wide foreshore
on the south side of the river mouth.</p>

<p>“He mak that beach,” the man replied promptly.
Then he pointed down at the northern beach where his
own boat was still lying. “I mak him dis way. But
I know. I sail him all time by the headland. So I
slip him current, an’ mak quick shelter by the headland.
Big ship not slip him current. Oh, no, he mak
so.” He swung an outstretched arm from right to
left, indicating a great sweep across the bay. “He
full current. An’&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Sasa.”</p>

<p>“Yep, boss.”</p>

<p>“Can we signal from that headland?”</p>

<p>The half-breed’s eyes widened.</p>

<p>“Wo’ for we signal. It no good sure. Him crazy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
white man not understand nothing. Him ship in the
Death Current. He go on. Oh, yes. Crazy white
man break all up bimeby.” He shrugged. “It all same
all time. Same lak that other who look into caves an’
climb rocks. I see him one time mak right out to sea
in canoe only built for river. Him current tak him.
I get him with my boat. I tak him back. He not say
nothing but curse me for a black son-of-a-bitch. Sure
he all break up bimeby.”</p>

<p>The doomed vessel was crashing on at terrific speed.
Already it was looming large as it approached the
headland. And now, as it drew nearer, its yawing
became more and more pronounced. For some moments
no one spoke while they contemplated the
wretched vessel’s impending fate. Then, as her high
bows disappeared behind the upstanding belt of the
headland, McLagan turned on his contemptuous
servant.</p>

<p>“Who’s the feller you’re talking about? The feller
who looks into caves and climbs rocks?” he asked
sharply.</p>

<p>The half-breed shrugged without withdrawing his
gaze from where the vessel was disappearing behind
the headland.</p>

<p>“How, I say? I not know. He come down the
river out of the hills. What you call him? All white
mans say him Li-as, yes? Indian man say him Devil
River. Oh, yes, he come this way. I see him one, two,
three time this man while I fish. He not see me, only
one time. Maybe he fish. I not know. Plenty fish
by Devil River. Oh, yes. Say, look, him come as I
say. See? The Death Current take him. So. See?”</p>

<p>He pointed. His narrow eyes were alight with
something almost like joy as the bows of the vessel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
cleared the headland and the doomed ship raced on for
the far beach.</p>

<p>“It much big tide. Oh, yes. He go right up to the
big rocks. Bimeby the tide fall. Then us go find
plenty thing. Food, clothes, blanket. All thing dead
white man not need more. So. I&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Quit it, you darn thief!” McLagan’s eyes were
furious as he turned on his ghoulish henchman. “And
you’ll stay right here and not move a step till Mr. Loby
and I get back. You’re nothing but a dirty scum of
a half-breed. And if I get you near that wreck without
my permission I’ll take you right in to Beacon and
get you hanged.”</p>

<p>He turned to Peter.</p>

<p>“It’s no good, boy. I can’t stand it. We’ve got to
do something. Poor devils, they’re surely doomed!
Come on. Maybe we can help some. We’ll go right
on down. We’ll get Sasa’s boat and ferry across to
where she’ll hit that beach. I&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I go too, boss.”</p>

<p>Sasa was no longer contemplating the wreck he had
hoped to enjoy. His attitude had suddenly become
one of pleading.</p>

<p>“You not mak that crossing without me,” he urged.
“I know. Him my boat, an’ I sail him good plenty.
You my good boss. You drown sure you sail him,
my boat. I come. Yes? I not tak white man’s blankets.
His food. His&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>McLagan raised a threatening hand.</p>

<p>“For God’s sake, shut up and come on!” he cried
impatiently. “Come on, Peter. Maybe ther’s women
down there. We’ll do what we can.”</p>

<p>The engineer waited for no reply. The vessel was
looming largely half-way across the bay. Now, as she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
passed into the shelter of the towering cliffs, her sails
were flapping and booming in the breeze. But she
was racing on to her destruction on the tremendous
current, helpless yet almost magnificent in her white
suiting over her black hull. It seemed incredible that
nothing could be done to save her. A fresh, calm
Spring day with a flat sea. And yet there was no help
for her.</p>

<p>Not a sound came up from her decks but the crashing
of her great sails. There was not a single human
voice crying out its agony of despair. Only there
came the mournful shrieks of the circling sea-fowl as
the men raced down the rocky pathway to the beach
below.</p>

<span class="fs95">The <i>Limpet</i> of Boston</span></h2>


<p class="drop-capy1">THE outlook of the day had materially changed
with the tide. The wind had increased mightily,
and the fine, fresh, early summer sky had changed to
one of banking storm-clouds which drove down out of
the northwest. It was a prospect of rough weather,
for all there were still moments when the sun broke
through the grey, and strove nobly to lighten the depressing
outlook.</p>

<p>McLagan and his companions were standing on the
slippery, weed-grown rocks. They were gazing speculatively
up at the high sides of the wrecked vessel as
she lay cradled upon the jagged belt of rocks which the
ebb of the tide had laid bare. She was lifted high out
of the water, for the flood tide had long since abandoned
her. It had done the work it had striven to
accomplish. It had flung its victim crashing upon the
trap concealed within its merciless bosom. And now,
in turn, satisfied, perhaps satiated, it had itself yielded
to the greater forces of Nature. As the waters receded
the vessel was left with her high, bluff nose stubbed
deeply into the sharply shelving beach, which alone
had saved her from complete destruction upon the
granite walls of the cliffs beyond.</p>

<p>It was a sight for real pity. Even to the unskilled
minds of these landsmen she was a fine, sturdy craft
that deserved better of the elements. There she lay,
slightly a-list, wounded and sorely stricken. Her forepeak<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
was literally disembowelled and they could only
guess at the damage the rest of her bottom had suffered.
Her yards were groaning under a hectoring
wind, and her torn sails were slashing and whipping
viciously in response to its onslaught. Her plates
seemed to be sprung in every direction, and she lay
there utterly helpless, awaiting the inevitable and complete
destruction that was yet to come.</p>

<p>McLagan had first approached the wreck on the
height of the tide. His purpose had been the simple
succour of those poor souls he had expected to find
on board. The adventure had been full of risk, even
under the consummate skill of the half-breed, who had
done his best. But the terrible tide, and the increasing
wind had defeated them, and, reluctantly enough, they
had been driven to a perilous stand-off while they hailed
the doomed vessel.</p>

<p>They had shouted. They shouted again and again,
seeking to make their voices heard above the roar of
the ocean rollers driving down upon the vessel’s side.
But the effort had been unavailing. There was not a
sign or sound of life about her, and their only response
was the roar of the sea and the mocking cries of the
sea-fowl whirling about her protesting rigging.</p>

<p>So in the end, they had been forced to yield. There
was no alternative. They dared not approach nearer.
Under the prevailing conditions their only hope of approaching
the wreck was to await the fall of the tide
and make the shore upon which it was piled.</p>

<p>But even so, their attempt had not been wholly fruitless.
They had discovered many things of deep interest.
They had discovered the vessel’s name, which was
set out plainly on her bluff stern. She was the <i>Limpet</i>,
and her port of registration was the city of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
Boston. Furthermore, they realised that though her
rudder post remained in place the rudder itself was
gone. Then they understood that she had the shape
and qualities of a coasting vessel of more than usual
deep-seagoing type. She was built for heavy weather
as well as the lighter work of her coasting trade, and
they beheld, too, a wireless aerial was still in its place
between her main and mizzen masts.</p>

<p>But in McLagan’s mind the greatest significance lay
in the fact that she was still laden with a deck cargo
of lumber, and all her top gear was intact, and all her
sails were set, and the only signs of her distress were
the inroads which the wind had made upon her canvas
suiting. From the distance, when she had first been
discovered, she had looked to be riding proudly, gallantly
to her death under full sail. But at close quarters
it was clearly evident that this had been something
of an illusion. Her sails were full set, it was true, but
there were many sad rents that were widening every
moment, and, in many places, their clews were straining
upon a last desperate hold.</p>

<p>Now, with the tide at its lowest ebb, standing beside
her on the rocks these men were less concerned for
her superstructure than for the evidence the rocks had
imposed upon her. Peter Loby was staring in simple
wonder at the yawning gash torn out of her bows.
Sasa Mannik, in true “wrecker” fashion, was contemplating
her from the point of view of his own advantage.
He was a sailorman, and here were gear, ropes
and canvas and possibly all the needs of his heart, for
the simple process of collecting them. He had no concern
for anything else. But Ivor McLagan gazed
upon her wrecked bows while his mind was preoccupied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
by the mystery of her presence in the remote inlet
where he had set up his home.</p>

<p>He was convinced now that she was without life
on board, but the condition of her fully set sails also
convinced him that her abandonment had taken place
in fair weather, perhaps, even, in a dead calm. He was
left quite unimpressed by her rudderless condition.
He argued that this disaster must have occurred after
her abandonment. For even to him it seemed impossible
that any responsible shipmaster could have set full
sail on a vessel without steering gear. Then, except
for the almost paintless condition of her rusted hull,
there was no other sign of distress about her. Her
deck cargo was aboard, and her boats, as far as he had
been able to judge, were snugged as though there had
never been a thought of the necessity for launching
them.</p>

<p>No, it was a curious, even mysterious visitation.
He understood, he had often enough heard of a lee-shore
and its dangers to a sailing vessel. Clearly
something of the sort must have happened. But not
in association with this vessel’s abandonment.</p>

<p>He turned abruptly to his subordinate and pointed
at the mass of rusted cable strewn about the rocks
fallen through the rent in the vessel’s side like the litter
of some wounded monster’s bowels.</p>

<p>“That looks to me the easy way aboard,” he said
sharply. “I don’t figger to know a deal when it comes
to sea-craft. But it likely seems the hole that belched
up that junk ought to be a way up to her decks.”</p>

<p>Peter nodded. He glanced up over the sprung plates
of her sides.</p>

<p>“It surely looks that way,” he agreed. “Maybe&mdash;Holy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
gee! Here! Get a look up there! Look at ’em!”
he cried excitedly, pointing up at the vessel’s rail.
“Ther’s scores! Ther’s regiments of ’em! Get a look
at those darn rats!”</p>

<p>All three men were staring up at a sight rarely
enough to be seen. Peter’s excited estimate was by
no means exaggerated. Just above the vessel’s rail
was an upstanding pile of lumber, and it was literally
swarming with rats of all sizes, from the full-grown,
long-whiskered, grey patriarchs down to the extreme
youth of the colony. They were running hither and
thither without apparent aim or object till it seemed
they must be participating in some sort of curious
rodent gambol or driven by senseless panic.</p>

<p>It was sufficiently repulsive to gaze upon. There
was something utterly repellent in it. For some reason
it is against human nature to view these pests without
deeply stirred feelings. And for all the hardiness of
these men the effect upon them now was wholly one
of loathing.</p>

<p>The scene only occupied a minute or so. Then, of
a sudden, one rat, bigger, it seemed, than all the rest,
suddenly made its appearance. He came to the rail of
the vessel. He seemed to be contemplating it closely,
or perhaps he was contemplating the men standing below
him on the rocks. Then, at last, apparently satisfied
with his survey, he set off along the rail on the
run. In a moment the rest were following behind.
They ran close together in single file, head to tail, till
they looked like a long, thick, moving, grey rope. At
a given point, the leader turned off back on to the deck,
and the swarming creatures pursued him.</p>

<p>With the passing from view of the hindmost, McLagan
spat and shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span></p>

<p>“Quitting,” he said. Then he laughed. “It’s the
way of things. She’s doomed. So&mdash;the rats are quitting.
Guess it makes me sick in the stomach. I’ll hail
you boys if I get through this way.”</p>

<p>He moved over to the great hole in the vessel’s side
and, stooping, peered within the dark cavity. He stood
there for a moment. Then Peter saw him move forward
and the hole swallowed him up.</p>

<p>For all the extent of the rent in the vessel’s side the
forepeak was dark and low and dank with the stench
of bilge and rust. McLagan was forced to move cautiously
over the piles of rusted cable, for he was utterly
unfamiliar with his surroundings. But soon his keen
eyes grew accustomed to the twilight and he was able
to measure with some accuracy the place in which he
found himself. A steel bulkhead shut him off from
the rest of the vessel’s hold, and the walls of the place
sloped inwards till their point of meeting was lost beneath
the tangle of chains at his feet. Right in the
centre he discovered a fixed iron companion ladder
standing sheerly erect. And examination showed him
that it mounted up through manholes to the top deck,
where a small, gaping hatchway revealed full daylight.</p>

<p>In a moment he was swarming towards the light
above.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The three men were standing in the narrow limits of
the ship’s cabin. It was small and unpretentious
enough, but not without some refinement of decoration.
The deck of the ship’s poop roofed the room, and, as
is usual in such cases, the ceiling it made to the cabin
was picked out in panels which were outlined in somewhat
striking but sufficiently harmonious colours. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
was the same with the walls, and the doors which
opened out of the apartment. The fixed chairs against
the centre table were of the usual ship’s mahogany,
and the upholstery was well-worn leather. There was
no other furnishing to the place except strips of somewhat
decayed carpeting pinned securely to the deck.</p>

<p>But there was that set out on the table which held
both the white men deeply preoccupied with its significance.
It was a meal obviously arranged for only
<em>one</em> man. And it was only half consumed. There was
no confusion, no litter, no sign of hasty abandonment,
except that the meal appeared to have been broken off
in the middle of it.</p>

<p>The table was partly covered with a white cloth that
had seen better and cleaner days. There was a dish
containing some sort of hash that had become dried
up. In front of what was obviously the captain’s seat
at the head of the table, and which faced the alleyway
entrance to the apartment, was a plate containing
the remains of a portion of the hash. This, too, was
dried up and shrivelled, and beside it lay a knife and
fork which were both smeared as with use in consuming
the food. Besides these, again, were the gnawed
remains of some broken bread, and a drink that was
clearly whisky and water.</p>

<p>Further along the table stood a dingy cruet. And
beyond this again was an uncut fruit pie. The crust
of this was almost gone, and that which remained was
sour-looking and mildewed. This, too, had been obviously
consumed by rats. And it was the same with
the contents of a bread basket which stood beside it.
Even the table-cloth itself had failed to escape the
insatiable depredations of the rodents. But the signs
were unmistakable. The meal had been interrupted.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
The man who had been devouring it had clearly been
suddenly inspired to abandon it, and for some unguessed
reason he had clearly failed to return.</p>

<p>McLagan raised a hand and pushed his cap back
from his forehead. It was a gesture of perplexity.</p>

<p>“It looks tough,” he said slowly. “It looks like that
feller didn’t take time to eat right for the darn hurry
he was in. He was a plain liver, too, I’d say. But he
surely was in an almighty hurry.”</p>

<p>Peter Loby nodded. Imagination in him was working
hard, but the result was negative. He glanced up
from the table and his eyes surveyed the walls with the
doors which opened out into what were clearly the officer’s
sleeping quarters. There were only three doors
besides the entrance from the alleyway.</p>

<p>“It’s the kind of thing to leave you guessing,” he
admitted. “We’ve looked right into it all from the
fo’castle head to this cabin. But ther’s still those state-rooms
yet. Maybe one of ’em’ll hand us the ship’s
papers and the log. That ought to tell us the story of
it. It’s most certainly queer.”</p>

<p>“Queer?” McLagan laughed shortly. He shook his
head. “That don’t say a thing. Think back, man.
What have we found so far? From the carpenter’s
shop under the fo’castle head to the men’s quarters
and the galley, and this, we’ve found just the thing
you’d expect to find in a full-crewed, well-found ship&mdash;except
the ship’s company itself.” He shrugged.
“There were chips and wood lying around in the tool
shop&mdash;and tools&mdash;just as if the boy who worked there
had only just quit his job. The men’s quarters in the
fo’castle looked to be in the sort of order you’d find
in a ship about to set out for sea, an’ before she’s taken
on her crew. As for the galley, you could start right<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
in to fix food there now and not be worried a thing,
except for being short on pots an’ things. Look at the
lumber stacked on the deck. It’s there ready for a sea-trip
without a stick or lashing out of place, and I’d say
the hold cargo’s likely the same. And as for the
boats&mdash;&mdash;” He paused and gazed thoughtfully about
him, and his eyes came to rest again on the rat-gnawed
food on the table, which held him fascinated.
“That’s the queerest thing of it all. This craft
was built with four boats and they’re all in place
snugged down, and I’d say they’ve never been unshipped
except for a coat of paint. Here’s a darn craft
been sailing loose for maybe weeks or months without
a soul on board we can locate, not even with the rats
belonging her&mdash;now. And there’s not a sign of how
or why the folks belonging her quit.”</p>

<p>He turned and flung himself into the chair that had
obviously been that usually occupied by the captain of
the vessel. He seemed to be completely at a loss. Peter
moved over to one of the doors, and peered into the
apartment beyond. Sasa displayed no curiosity. His
dark eyes were unusually wide, and a curious brooding
light left them almost expressionless. He stood staring
down at the littered table, and after a few prolonged
moments of silence, McLagan stirred irritably in his
chair.</p>

<p>“Get around in those three state-rooms, or whatever
they are, Peter, an’ take the darn breed with you,” he
cried. “Poke around and smell out. Sasa’ll be more
use that way than gawking like some darn mutt around
here. If you find a thing, shout me. I’m stopping
around to worry this thing out right here.”</p>

<p>McLagan was rarely enough given to irritation. But
oppressive irritation was driving him now. He remained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
where he was until his lieutenant and the half-breed
had passed into the first of the three compartments.
Then, as the door swung to behind them, he
started up and passed swiftly from the room. Moving
down the alleyway, beyond the steward’s pantry, he
came to the break of the poop and out into the daylight.</p>

<p>Here he paused. It was good to be out in the air
again, and a sense of relief came to him as he surveyed
the scene. The main deck here was clear of cargo. It
was clean, almost as clean as if it had only just endured
the attentions of the sand and canvas so beloved of the
seaman. Rope-ends, that should have been neatly
cleated, or coiled away, were littered where the weather
had flung them, but it was the only sign of any confusion.</p>

<p>He breathed his relief as he leant against the doorway
and surveyed it all with contemplative eyes. The
wind was screaming through the rigging and the torn
sails were booming out their protests. The sky was
darkening with a real threat of storm, and beyond the
high prow of the wreck the grey walls of the bay rose
up gaunt and forbidding.</p>

<p>The whole thing had gotten hold of McLagan in a
curiously depressing fashion. He felt that somehow
there was an unusual story lying behind the circumstances
of this fair-weather wreck. And his practical
mind was searching every avenue that opened up to its
vision.</p>

<p>Mutiny? His mind naturally turned to mutiny, but
he dismissed the thought immediately. There was not
a sign of mutiny from the ship’s bows to her stern-post.
There was not a sign of force or struggle, and
her boats were in place. Storm? He shook his head.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
No storm had broken the heart of her crew. What else
was there to cause her abandonment? Nothing. No.
Look which way he would, there was no reasonable solution
in the vessel’s condition. There had been a
purely voluntary exodus, orderly, quiet, even if hasty.
Of that he was convinced. There was no other conclusion
to come to. No. Whatever there still remained
to be discovered in her holds, and in those cabins behind
him, there was nothing much else for him to do
but to drive into Beacon on the work he had in hand,
and carry in with him the report of this wreck to Alan
Goodchurch, who represented the United States Government
for the district. That would have to be done.
But meanwhile&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>A curious look crept suddenly into his narrow eyes.
He was looking out straight before him down the
deck. Immediately in his focus were the securely battened
main hatch and the galley and the fo’castle.
There were the iron-shod steps of the companion-ladder
up to the roof of these, and, to the right of that stood
a tarpaulin-covered winch, with behind it the donkey-engine
room. His gaze was riveted on the deckway
that passed beyond this and which was stacked high
with great baulks of lumber.</p>

<p>But it was not these things which had inspired the
curious, questioning, incredulous look with which he
gazed upon them. It was something else. Something
which startled him, and made him turn quickly to the
stormy sky, which, at that moment, had broken to
permit a pallid beam of sunshine to make its way
through. It was only for a moment he looked up, however.
Then again he became absorbed in the deck
ahead of him.</p>

<p>Suddenly he stood erect. He had abandoned his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
lounging. The doubt in his eyes had given place to
something else which baffled description. He drew a
deep breath, while a chilly sensation passed through
his great body and left him with a feeling of curious
helplessness.</p>

<p>He remained unmoving. His fascinated gaze was
still held. Not for a moment did it shift. It almost
seemed as if it were impossible for him to look away.
Then the grey of the storm-clouds closed up again and
the sunbeam faded out. And as it did so he raised a
hand slowly, almost involuntarily, and passed it hesitatingly
across his forehead.</p>

<p>With that movement mobility returned to him. He
turned and glanced back into the alleyway. The next
moment the sharp tones of his voice rang out.</p>

<p>“Anything doing, boy?” he called, harshly. And he
followed up his question by hastily passing back into
the cabin.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The search was over. McLagan and Peter Loby
were standing at the break of the poop-deck. Sasa
Mannik had separated from the others and was squatting
hunched upon the main hatch. He was watching
the white men, contemplating them with narrowed eyes
while his shrewd native mind was following a train of
thought which deeply preoccupied him.</p>

<p>“I’m not a thing wiser,” Peter said in reply to a
question. “There wasn’t a scrap of paper, or a bunch
of human clothes. But I wouldn’t rely on that too
much. You see, I hurried, an’ when you’re looking
that way you’re liable to miss things. Ther’s one of
those rooms for wireless. The other two were bunks.
One with one bunk and the other with two. Both had
bed fixings and they looked so they hadn’t been slept<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
in. It gets me beat. The lockers were plumb empty,
just as though they’d been cleared out to leave no trace.
It’s the queerest&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>He broke off. Sasa’s harsh voice had broken in on
him. He had risen from his place on the hatch, and
his eyes had widened out of their usual narrowing.</p>

<p>“I go,” he said, sharply. “This bad ship&mdash;no good.
Bimeby I not come back ever.”</p>

<p>He turned and glanced almost fearfully about him.</p>

<p>“Why, Sasa? You don’t like it? Why?”</p>

<p>McLagan’s questions came sharply and on the instant.
There was a half smile in his eyes. But there
was nothing smiling behind them.</p>

<p>Sasa spat viciously on the deck.</p>

<p>“Bad spirit plenty,” he said with native panic in his
widened eyes. “I go.”</p>

<p>And without waiting for reply, or, perhaps, because
he feared lest he should be detained, he passed quickly
across to the vessel’s rail where a heavy downhaul was
sprawled on the deck. He flung it over the side. And
in a moment he had followed it, and was swarming
down to the rocks below.</p>

<p>“This thing’s got on his nerves,” Peter laughed.</p>

<p>McLagan nodded. But there was no responsive
laughter.</p>

<p>“And I don’t somehow wonder,” he said. Then he
shrugged. “I guess we can’t do any good here now.
I’ll get along back, and pass right on into Beacon. I’ll
need to make a report to Goodchurch on this. I surely
will.”</p>

<span class="fs95">The “Come-back”</span></h2>


<p class="drop-capy1">A RADIANT sky was smiling down upon the
forest-clad hills. Somewhere away to the West
the sun was lolling just above the horizon. For the
moment its glory was lost behind the ranging hills with
their garments of every shade of green. There was
no cloud to be seen anywhere from the purpling distance
of the snow-capped mountains in the East, to the
western splendour of the summer sunset.</p>

<p>Cy Liskard was squatting over a camp fire that was
built just outside his log home on the hillside. Nearby
his dogs were pursuing some evening pastime that appealed
to their savage natures. Maybe it was play,
but the snarls that were so frequently accompanied by
the fierce snapping of ivory-shod jaws suggested the
narrow line dividing it from canine warfare.</p>

<p>His ponies were beyond the fence of a small, roughly
constructed corral, and they stood close up to it at a
point most nearly approaching the home of the man
it was their life’s burden to serve. Their shaggy heads,
still rough with the remains of a winter coat, which
neglect had left clinging to them, were thrust over the
log rail. They were clearly waiting with equine patience
the long overdue attention to which they had
full right.</p>

<p>The man disregarded their appeal; he was in a mood
to disregard any duty that might have been his. Even
the claims of his own stomach were forgotten in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
consuming depths of impotent rage that were driving
him. His expressionless eyes gazed out through the
smudge of smoke which lolled heavily upon the still,
fresh mountain air. His view was over the range of
his gold workings, which lay down below upon the
wide bank of the creek. But for all, his gaze was for
the thing which held him to his mountain solitude, his
thought was left all unconcerned for it.</p>

<p>He had returned from Beacon only that noon. The
long trail had claimed him for days, as the condition of
his fleshless ponies testified. He had driven hard and
mercilessly, for there was that behind him which impelled
him in a fashion he had never known before.
But the thing which had driven him had no relation to
fear, or, if it had, his apprehension was utterly lost in
the rage that smouldered behind his pale eyes. He had
driven his ponies to their last extremity out of an almost
crazy desire for speed and movement that he
might reach the security of his home for the sole purpose
of nursing his fierce desire for swift vengeance
upon Ivor McLagan.</p>

<p>He sat with his rough hands clasped about his knees.
He remained unmoving. There was room for nothing
in the mind behind his stony stare but the fierce longing
to hurt, and the method by which it could be achieved.</p>

<p>He felt himself to be beyond the reach of the men
of the Aurora Clan. He felt himself free from every
threatening human danger, lost in the heart of these
distant hills. As for the threat of that which his return
to Beacon might mean, he dismissed it without a
moment’s consideration. He intended to return to
Beacon just whenever it suited him. It might entail
watchfulness. It would undoubtedly entail sufficient
weapons of defence. But he never moved without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
these. And in the open and in the daylight fully prepared,
he knew himself to be a match for these absurdly
tricked out bunglers who sought to impress their
will upon a foolish, credulous, awed bunch of white-livered
citizens.</p>

<p>No. It was not against the men of the Aurora Clan
that his fury was directed. He held them in contempt
for all they had forced from him an oath under threat
of hanging. He knew well enough the nearness to
disaster to which he had been brought. He knew they
had meant their threat and would have hanged him
out of hand had he failed to yield his oath. Their
other doings were not unknown to him. He had
heard of Bernard’s and other outrages, but the whole
thing had left him unimpressed. When men were
driven to spectre-play to achieve their ends he felt that
sufficient boldness could defeat them all the time. So
these white-shirted creatures with their cedar boughs,
and rawhide hanging ropes, were dismissed from his
mind leaving him free to contemplate that other who
had brought about his undoing at the Speedway.</p>

<p>Ivor McLagan! Oh, he knew the man by reputation.
Furthermore, he knew the work he was engaged
upon and where that work was being done and this was
the man against whom all his rage and desire for
vengeance were directed.</p>

<p>Once he released his clasped hands, and, reaching
out one heavily booted foot, kicked the embers of
his fire together. With the sunset the air of the mountains
was chill enough. For all the man’s toughness,
for all the thick pilot cloth of his pea-jacket, and the
thick flannel he wore underneath, the chill bit harshly
and forced him to regard the life of his fire. He flung
a number of logs on to it from his near-by stack of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
fuel and edged closer to the leaping blaze. Then
again his arms embraced his knees, and he yielded himself
to the schemes and plans which sprang so readily
to his mind.</p>

<p>The wound inside his lips was still raw where McLagan’s
blow had split open the flesh against his teeth.
But he needed no reminder. He never would need reminding.
The memory of that night was indelibly
fixed upon a mind which was utterly incapable of forgetting
an injury. But such evidence as still remained
only the more surely drove his headlong desire. He
meant to kill Ivor McLagan, and the only problem that
presented itself to him was the manner he should prefer
for the accomplishment of his purpose.</p>

<p>Oh, yes. He would kill McLagan. He would have
killed him at the Speedway, or some time that night,
but for the men who had smothered him in their numbers.
Well, he was beyond their interference now.
He was out in the open. There was only the open between
him and McLagan, a vast, rugged back country,
where there was no human agency to interfere between
him and his vengeance. Yes, out there they were far
hidden from the rest of the world with only the hills
to fling back the death-cry he would wring from
his&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>He broke off from his lusting thought. A broad
beam of the dying sun’s light drove its way through
the loose arms of a woodland bluff. It lit the ground
on which he sat, and enveloped his hunched body. He
turned with all the alertness he might have displayed
in the presence of an enemy, and his expressionless
eyes looked into the blaze of light. For a moment the
illusion was complete. Low down on the horizon the
sun was sinking to its final rest, and as it passed from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
view it looked like a world of consuming fire devouring
the woods which lay in the path of its amazing light.</p>

<p>It was only for an instant that his narrowed eyes
confronted the intolerable burden of its fierce light.
Then he sprang to his feet and moved away, and his
going was something almost precipitate, headlong. In
a moment he had vanished within the doorway of his
primitive home.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The moon was at the full of its glory. The night
was no less cloudless than had been the close of day.
The sky was ablaze with stars, but from the heart of
the hills no aurora was visible.</p>

<p>Down on the creek below Cy Liskard’s home the
world seemed severely limited. On either hand, before
and behind, the hills rose sharply in every direction.
It was overpowering, overwhelming. The sky above
was transformed into a narrow canopy, with the silver
of the moon shining directly down upon the bosom of
the little creek. The region was brilliantly lit by its
ghostly light. Every detail of it was sharply outlined,
and it flung the ghostly shadows of the trees in every
direction. Then the waters of the creek, still flowing
with something of their Spring freedom, were transformed
into a perfect ribbon of silver.</p>

<p>Midnight was gone and the small hours were slowly
growing. The valley was full of the strange night
sounds of a creature world whose day it was. Cries
came echoing down through the forest which clothed
the hillsides, and the voices of water life kept up an
incessant chorus. It was a world of Nature’s unutterable
peace&mdash;and something else.</p>

<p>There was movement about the banks of the creek.
There was movement amongst the gear of the gold-seeker.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
So, too, was it on the broad hillside about the
cabin where Cy Liskard had abandoned himself to the
blankets which nightly claimed him. It was the silent,
ghostly movement of white-robed figures. They stood
out in sharp relief under the brilliant light of the moon.
They came and passed on. They paused. They
crouched, searching. They moved without haste, or
apparent fear of disturbance. And their long white
gowns and high-peaked head pieces transformed them
from living humanity into the spirits of the night.</p>

<p>The thing that was in progress was plain enough to
read. The white-clad figures were searching the valley
of the gold workings for information of the “strike”
which the sleeping man had made. Their movement
made it impossible to estimate their numbers with any
accuracy, for the forest, reaching down to the water’s
edge in many places, hid up much of it. Possibly there
were a dozen. Possibly less. But, whatever the number,
the search was utterly exhaustive. The corral,
the log hut on the hillside were not left unexplored,
and the presence of the man’s dogs only made it something
curious that no canine voice had been raised in
protest.</p>

<p>There was not a sound to disturb the night or to
give alarm to the sleeping man. The dogs lay huddled
on the ground as though in the deepest slumber and the
man slept on profoundly while the figures moved about
the interior of his quarters.</p>

<p>It was all curious. But there was doubtless an answer
to it. These men had travelled far and hard
under the strictest orders to return with a full report
of the gold strike made by Cy Liskard. Their report
depended on a complete and uninterrupted investigation.
There were many means of accomplishing this.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
It would have been simple enough to deal with the man
himself. In their numbers they could have taken him
in his blankets. But perhaps they had no desire that
he should be aware of their visitation. In that case
there were other measures. Similar measures such as
had doubtless silenced the dogs. A whiff of some
pungent narcotic and the sleep of these creatures, human
as well as canine, would be infallibly prolonged.</p>

<p>The search went on to its conclusion. It was prolonged
and completely thorough. And when the movements
of the Aurora men ceased and their ghostly
figures no longer haunted the valley, the moon had
passed from her throne in the heavens and the star-light
was already beginning to fade out. Then came
darkness, utter and complete. It was the darkness
preceding dawn. And the valley of the Lias River
was given up wholly to the haunting sounds of the
night.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Cy Liskard was ashore at a landing on the river he
had made his own. His stout canoe was lying moored
to the overhanging trunk of a tree, and it swung away
at the end of its rawhide to the easy stream. A roll of
blankets lay in the bottom of it while his camp outfit
was littered upon the gravelly foreshore about his feet.
It was noon or thereabouts, and the day was overcast
and threatening. But down here on the river was the
pleasant warmth of a summer day.</p>

<p>He was gazing out downstream, and his view was
of a great expanse of flowing water moving heavily
on towards the sea. There were many miles between
him and the coast yet. The journey would run into
something approaching one hundred and more, which
it would take days to travel. But it was not the distance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
he had yet to go that preoccupied him. It was
not the scene set out before him with its amazing hills
and dense forests growing down to the water’s edge.
He was literally and perhaps spiritually at the parting
of the ways.</p>

<p>Directly ahead of him a hill reared its lofty crest.
It stood up an indestructible barrier to the rushing
waters hurtling on towards the distant ocean. It had
faced the fierce onslaught of the stream throughout
the ages. It had yielded nothing but the loose soil
about its rocky base. And so the waters which refused
denial to their progress had turned sharply away in
face of its heroic resistance.</p>

<p>Somewhere to the north of that hill he knew that
another river flowed over an almost parallel course.
It was a smaller river which owed its source to the
same world of hills as that which bred the flood of the
Lias. But it was not for its proximity he was concerned.
It was not for its relation to his own. It was
because, somewhere further down its course, Ivor McLagan’s
oil camp was pitched. And Ivor McLagan
was the man who had hurt and thwarted him.</p>

<p>Somehow the night had at first wrought a change in
the almost insane mood in which Cy Liskard had
sought his blankets. He had awakened heavily, with
a feeling of unusual depression. He had awakened
without any yearning for immediate action against the
man who had hurt him. He had found himself contemplating
his future outlook without enthusiasm or
deep interest, and it was not until he had broken his
fast, and perfunctorily executed the simple chores he
was accustomed to perform, that his evil spirit returned
to its full dominion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span></p>

<p>But even then he had been incapable of rising to the
pitch of desire which had stirred him the night before.
Perhaps it was the balance of sanity reasserting itself.
Perhaps it was the result of that long, deep sleep which
had robbed him of the night vision of the movements
of the men of the Aurora Clan. Whatever it was, he
decided definitely that his vengeance upon Ivor McLagan
could wait. There was all the summer for that,
and meanwhile, there was urgent work lying ahead of
him in another direction. Perhaps a year more of
these solitudes and his work would be finished. Yes,
in that time he would have completed everything. And
the while, McLagan would have forgotten and lulled
himself into a sense of security. Then, at his
leisure&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>So he had gone about his simple preparations. He
prepared his boat down on the river. He loaded it with
his camp outfit and provisioned it. Then he turned his
ponies loose to fend for themselves on such mountain
feed as they could find in his absence. And his trail
dogs he treated in similar fashion. These creatures
were subsidiary. His boat was the thing he knew and
understood.</p>

<p>But this more temperate mood had been in the early
morning. Since then there had been hours of labour
on his journey downstream. And the work of it had
lightened the dullness of his earlier inspiration. By
high noon he had been completely flung back upon his
desire for the life of the man he had encountered in
Beacon.</p>

<p>So he stood before the great bend of the river where
the angry waters beat impotently against the foot of
the mountain and raced away to the south in search of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
the outlet they refused to be denied. And all his passion
for revenge was burning deep behind his soulless
eyes.</p>

<p>Why should he wait? Why should he deny himself?
There was all summer for the rest as well as for that
other. Why not reverse the thing? The rest could
wait, far more easily wait than the vengeance he desired.
It would be better so. For just so long as
Ivor McLagan lived, he, Liskard, would never know
peace of mind. What was it? At the most a ten or
twelve mile portage to the north of that hill. He had
made it before when he had looked to discover for
what purpose his neighbours were around. Yes. And
the Alsek was an easy river. He could pass down it
at his leisure until he came to the oil camp. He could
cache his boat while he searched the place for the man
whose life he desired. Then, if he were not there but
down at the river mouth where he had built his crazy
home on the cliffs, he could pass on down beyond the
camp in the night and stalk his quarry.</p>

<p>It would be easy&mdash;so easy. There would be no need
to take chances. His rifle could do the job at his
leisure. The man’s home was perched up for long-range
shots. He could remain under cover&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Yes, the rest could wait. It must wait. His desire
was overwhelming, irresistible. He would eat at once
and pass over to the landing he knew of at the foot of
the mountain. The water was turbulent enough there.
There were rapids of no mean proportions to be negotiated.
But they were nothing to him&mdash;nothing this
river could show him could match his watercraft.</p>

<p>He moved back from the water’s edge. His decision
was final. So he prepared a fire for his noon
meal.</p>

<p class="drop-capy1">“I’M kind of glad you could run down, Peter. I’ve
put that report through to our people. This is
the message I handed ’em.”</p>

<p>Ivor McLagan held out the copy of the message he
had despatched from Beacon, and, while his assistant
read it, he stood with narrowed eyes gazing down upon
the wrecked vessel standing high out of the waters of
the bay below.</p>

<p>He had not long returned from Beacon, and Peter
Loby had made a special trip down the river to meet
him. Deeply as McLagan was concerned for any further
news his subordinate might have brought from
the camp on the river, the wreck below had lost none
of its interest for him. In fact, for some unexplained
reason, it had taken even a firmer hold upon his imagination.</p>

<p>Curiosity had by no means a prominent place in his
psychology. Ordinarily he was not seriously concerned
for happenings which had no intimate relation to
the affairs of his life. He was sufficiently self-centred
in the work that was his to leave such a thing as the
sudden appearance of a derelict of the sea, flung almost
on his doorstep, a thing without more than passing
interest, after he had ascertained that no human life
stood in need of his succour. But strangely enough
the vessel lying upon its deathbed below him, claimed
him with greater force than he would have cared to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
admit. His mind had been full of it on his journey
into Beacon. Its memory had remained with him and
deeply increased its spell, as he made his report to Alan
Goodchurch, and his journey back to his home on the
cliffs had been made with haste inspired by the strange
feeling of unrest with which the thought of those last
moments he had spent on the deck of the vessel had
filled him.</p>

<p>Now the wreck was standing out amidst its rugged
surroundings, under a blaze of sunshine, and, as his
gaze took in its details, his mind was full of questioning
and unease. The condition of the vessel had apparently
changed very little. The tides that had passed
since his first visit to it had left it wholly undisturbed.
Its sails were in worse shape, and their tattered remains
fluttered and whipped furiously in the breeze and sent
the gulls screaming as they sought to find resting place
on the creaking yards. But he was not thinking of
any of these things. No, he was thinking&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Peter looked up from his reading.</p>

<p>“That’s a good report, McLagan,” he conceded with
a grin. “It’s a deal better done than mine. I surely
guess that’ll set our folks smiling a mile wide.” He
drew a deep breath. “Well, they can keep right on
grinning. They’re on a bonanza, or I’m all sorts of a
mutt.”</p>

<p>He gazed up into the face of his chief as he offered
his frank comment and passed back the copy of the
message.</p>

<p>“It makes me feel good,” he went on quickly, “standing
around out here, perched right up on this darn
rock breathing good sea air an’ soaking in elegant sunshine
with our play coming right. Makes the world
seem right someway. Makes me sort of feel I want<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
to holler like a school kid on Thanksgiving Day. Oil?
It’s the most crazily wonderful thing in the world&mdash;when
you strike it.”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>McLagan’s response was without a shadow of the
other’s enthusiasm and Peter turned questioningly.
Instantly he realised the direction of his chief’s
gaze and the meaning of his preoccupation. He chuckled.</p>

<p>“I’d forgot that crazy barge,” he said. Then he
added: “You handed Goodchurch the dope?”</p>

<p>The difference in the attitude of these men was profoundly
marked. The lean, practical oil man was alert
and thrilling with the prospect lying ahead of the work
they were both engaged upon. The wreck and the
atmosphere of mystery which it had originally impressed
upon him had entirely passed out of his concern.
He had witnessed the wreck. He had explored
it. He had shared in the risk of that first approach.
But none of these things, not even the vision of the
deserting rats, had been sufficient to persist in a mind
absorbed in his lifetime’s pursuit of oil. The affairs of
the oil prospect were paramount with him, first, last
and all the time. And the report he had just perused
represented something approaching the crowning of his
life’s work. But at that moment, oil and coal were
the two things farthest from McLagan’s mind.</p>

<p>The latter moved away and approached the edge of
the wide ledge upon which his hut was set. Peter
moved up beside him and bit a chew of tobacco from
the disreputable fragment of plug tobacco which he
carried in his hip-pocket.</p>

<p>As McLagan nodded his gaze was still upon the
wreck below.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span></p>

<p>“Surely,” he said. “I handed it the best I could,
and Goodchurch guessed things would need looking
into. He took down the name of the ship and its port
of registration. He’s wiring right away to the proper
authority and promised to get it broadcast by wireless.
I asked him for that. You see, I kind of got a hunch
the folks who quit that vessel might be glad to locate
her&mdash;if they’re alive. He reckons we’ll likely get
word from the owners. You know, Peter, I feel ther’s
a mighty queer story lying back of that wreck.”</p>

<p>“You mean&mdash;the boats&mdash;and&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>McLagan shook his head. He was gazing out to sea
now and stood abstractedly filling his pipe.</p>

<p>“No,” he said. Then his eyes came back again to
the scene of the wreck with the screaming sea-birds
circling about it. “Psha!” he cried impatiently.
“What’s the use? Yes, the boats if you like. It’s the
whole darn thing. It’s got me guessing, so I can’t
forget it.”</p>

<p>Peter chuckled.</p>

<p>“That’s all right,” he said. “It don’t worry me a
thing. It’s oil for mine. You can play around with
all the wrecks if you fancy that way. I’m beating it
right back to camp.”</p>

<p>McLagan nodded.</p>

<p>“Yes. It’s oil, not wrecks, for you an’ me,” he said,
as though striving to convince himself. “I know that.
But&mdash;yes, you beat it right back to camp and I’ll be
along up the moment I touch the answer our folks send
to that report. I’ll just wait around for that. I’m
figgering there’ll be a big move on that new field when
we get word. The drilling we’re doing now looks like
it’ll be a circumstance to the thing coming. Maybe
I’ll even have to run down to Seattle, after I’ve made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
my own inspection. Still, that won’t be till the late
fall.”</p>

<p>Peter agreed, his keen eyes lighting afresh.</p>

<p>“That’s how it looks to me,” he said.</p>

<p>“Yes. Are you stopping around to eat?”</p>

<p>“No. I’ll make camp on the river. I’ll pass up on
slack water and grab the tide later.” Peter laughed
and nodded down at the wreck. “You’ll get another
look at that while you’re waiting reply from our folks,”
he observed slily.</p>

<p>“Sure I will.” McLagan looked round quickly as he
thrust his pipe into the corner of his mouth, and his
strong jaws shut tight on its well-bitten stem. “Just
as soon as you beat it.”</p>

<p>“I thought so.” Peter was chuckling. “Well, it
doesn’t rattle me a thing. The only thing worrying
me is the yarn lying back of the coal belt we’ve located.
I’m sure crazy to get after that. So&mdash;I’ll beat it. So
long.”</p>

<p>McLagan smiled at the other’s thrust.</p>

<p>“So long, boy.”</p>

<p>He stood gazing after the slim figure of his lieutenant
as he hurried towards the head of the pathway
down from the ledge on which they were standing. He
waited till the last of his cloth cap vanished below the
level. Then he lit his pipe and turned again to his
absorbed contemplation of the mystery boat below.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The breeze was dead flat. It was low water. In
something under an hour the tide would be starting its
flood again. Meanwhile, the sky had clouded over.
But it was without any storming threat. It was only
the fleecy shading which came so frequently with the
change of tide.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span></p>

<p>Sasa Mannik’s eyes had curiously widened as they
gazed up into the face of the man he served. They
were alight with all the superstitious fear of his kind.
He had just concluded a long and almost incoherent
protest which his boss’s demand for his assistance
aboard the wreck had brought forth.</p>

<p>McLagan’s face was frowning. His eyes were
coldly contemptuous. He stood a towering figure over
the sturdy little man who was in open revolt.</p>

<p>“You’re worse than a darn fool, Sasa,” he said
sharply. “You’re a low, miserable coward. You’re
the worst coward I know. You’re such a coward you’d
run a mile from a jack-rabbit. You make me sick to
death, and I feel like sending you to hell out of my
service. I tell you there’s not a thing to this poor
darn wreck to scare a buck louse. There’s not a thing.
She’s dead and done, and there’s not a living soul
aboard.” Then he changed his tone from condemnation
to derision. “What the hell scares you about her?
What d’you think she’s got aboard her? Devils or&mdash;what?”</p>

<p>The half-breed turned away. He glanced down at
his own boat lying half out of water on the smooth
surface of the rocks on which it had been hauled up.
Perhaps he desired to reassure himself it was still there
for his safe retreat. A moment later he turned again
to the white man, and from him he gazed up at the
high sides of the great vessel which loomed monstrously
as they stood on the slippery rocks below it.
And as he gazed up at the hated object his eyes further
widened, and he spoke in a tone that was almost a
whine.</p>

<p>“Maybe, boss,” he said. He shook his dark head
vigorously. “This thing bad. So bad. I see him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
same lak you see him, too. I know. It in your eye
when you look. You scare, too, plenty. You not
know. I know. I much coward this thing. Nothing
else I scare lak him dis. I not go aboard. Never.”</p>

<p>McLagan’s gaze was compelling. He held the other
while he put his question.</p>

<p>“This thing? What did you see?” he asked sharply.</p>

<p>The half-breed shifted his position uneasily. He
sought to avoid the white man’s questioning eyes. He
turned away. But his fearful eyes came swiftly back
to those they had sought to avoid.</p>

<p>“I not speak this thing,” he said in a low, surly tone.
“It bad. What you ask him? You see. Oh, yes. I
know.”</p>

<p>He made a movement. It was almost like a shudder.
Then without waiting he passed down to his boat.</p>

<p>“Sasa!”</p>

<p>McLagan’s voice brought the terrified creature to a
standstill. He turned and waited. And then he heard
the white man laugh as he flung his final orders.</p>

<p>“You take your boat and go back to the beach. You
wait there till I hail you. If you leave that beach till I
hail you I’ll beat the life out of you. Now go.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>McLagan had made no further attempt at investigation
of the secrets of the wrecked vessel. It was
with an unusual feeling of repulsion that he climbed
up through the gloomy precincts of the forepeak. And
somehow the memory of the half-breed’s accusation
stung him sharply, as, involuntarily, his searching gaze
sought to penetrate the darkness surrounding him. In
his heart he felt the man was not without justification
in his charge. From the moment he had set foot on
the ladder a strange sensation took hold of him, and,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
with every upward step, he wondered what revelation
the next would yield.</p>

<p>Once on deck, however, the uncanny sensation
passed. Here was daylight. Here were the things
he knew and recognised. But somehow he did not
want to use the forepeak again, and forthwith he set
about discovering some other means of reaching the
deck.</p>

<p>He found it quickly. It was there lying amidst some
sprawled gear upon the deck, besides a stack of lumber.
It was a long rope companion ladder with broad teakwood
steps. It was still secured to the down haul
cleats against the ship’s rail near the main mast where
it had evidently been flung by some previous user. And
he dropped it over the vessel’s side, and saw that it
reached almost to the rocks below.</p>

<p>His view was out over the bay. And from where
he stood he could see his hut perched high on the cliffs,
and, below, the long, low line of the distant beach. He
smiled to himself as he beheld the figure of Sasa busy
mooring his fishing boat. He knew that for all his
rebellious mood, the half-breed would very literally
obey his final orders.</p>

<p>He turned away. His searching gaze took in the
deck in every direction. It was the same, precisely, as
he had found it on his first visit. The litter of gear
was in evidence everywhere. The stacked lumber.
There was the canvas-sheathed winch with its close-hauled
raking arm. The galley with its steel door ajar.
Then the closely battened main hatch, and, beyond it,
the break of the small poop-deck above, with its two
alleyways, one to the cabin, and one to the half-deck
on the starboard side. Yes. It was all just as he had
left it, and he glanced quickly up at the sky.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span></p>

<p>There was a thin overcast of cloud, but still without
any threat of storm. Even the restless ocean breeze
had flattened out, and the usually protesting gear above
him was completely silent.</p>

<p>McLagan had told himself that he wanted to explore
the hundred and one details which he knew must have
escaped him at his first visit. There were the battened
holds. There were those cabins which Peter and the
half-breed had looked into. There were the pantry, and
the half-deck. All these things he had promised himself
to look into. It was his excuse for his visit. But
he knew that in reality they had little enough to do with
his coming now. It was that other thing which had
brought him there. That thing which had inspired
terror in the half-breed’s heart, and&mdash;&mdash; He moved
over to the cabin alleyway and leant against the break
of the poop. And he stood gazing down the deck in
the direction of the winch as he had stood there once
before.</p>

<p>For all Sasa’s challenge McLagan’s nerve was completely
unruffled. He was a man of cool courage and
utterly ungiven to vain imaginings. Imagination was
by no means lacking, but it was under the perfect control
of a completely healthy mind.</p>

<p>He remained for some time in the position he had
taken up, and smoked contentedly for all the expectancy
in his eyes. But after awhile, wearying of his
vigil, he moved away, and squatted himself on the battened
hatch in precisely the position which Sasa Mannik
had once occupied. Here he hunched himself with his
arms locked about his knees, and sat regarding the
long prospect of the littered deck.</p>

<p>The trend of his thought had remained unchanged.
And the look in his eyes retained its unvarying expectancy,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
even when now and again he turned them skywards
searching the summer shading. Time seemed
to concern him not at all. That presently the flood tide
would begin, and there might be difficulty for Sasa
to bring his boat alongside, did not seem to enter his
thought. He sat there completely preoccupied with the
thing that was in his mind, and luxuriating in the comfort
of his pipe.</p>

<p>Suddenly he started. And his watchful eyes
changed from expectancy to a flashing alertness. A
sound had broken up the perfect quiet. It was a
sound that had no relation to creaking gear, or the
flap of sail cloth, or the raucous screaming of sea-fowl.
Seemingly it had no relation to anything he understood.
For he remained precisely where he was, waiting,
while his eyes focussed on the spot whence the
sound came.</p>

<p>It came from nearby to the main-mast. It came
from somewhere just abreast of the carefully covered
winch. There was the galley entrance there, and beyond
that a stack of stowed lumber&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>He started to his feet, and the look in his eyes had
changed again. He was smiling. A head had appeared
over the vessel’s rail. It was a head adorned by a
woman’s modish hat, with, underneath it, a face the
sight of which filled him with nothing but delight. He
hurried down the deck.</p>

<p>“Why, say, Claire,” he cried. “How did you&mdash;&mdash; Here,
wait. Get a grip on my hand. You shouldn’t
have&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>There was a moment of effort while McLagan took
firm hold of the girl’s two small hands. Then after a
struggle, a little breathlessly, she jumped lightly down
from the rail and stood beside him on the deck.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span></p>

<p>“I just had to come, Ivor,” she cried, gazing curiously
about her while she made her explanation. “I
heard about it in town, and set out right away. Mum’s
back there with the car on the hill road, and I came
along down to the beach where I saw your man with
his boat.” She laughed. “He didn’t want to, but I
made him. I asked for you, and he said you were
aboard here. I asked him why, and he said because
you were ‘dam fool white man.’ Then I guess I offered
him five dollars to bring me across, and he nearly threw
a fit. He refused. But I insisted. It cost me ten before
I was through, and the threat you’d beat him if
he didn’t. Even then he tried to dodge it and guessed
you’d beat him if he left the beach. But I got my way.
And&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“As you mostly do.”</p>

<p>McLagan was thinking rapidly and with sudden deep
concern. This girl was all the world to him, and her
presence, her proximity filled him with a wild sensation
of joy that he was powerless to deny, that he made
no attempt to deny. But, of a sudden, he had become
horrified as he contemplated the real purpose of his
own visit to the derelict. In a moment his mind was
made up. By some means he must get her off the ship&mdash;before&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>There was no smile in his eyes now.</p>

<p>“I kind of wish you hadn’t, Claire. I guess I’ll have
to deal with Sasa for disobeying his orders. He was
told not to quit that beach for&mdash;anything.”</p>

<p>The girl looked up into the man’s face and the flash
of hot resentment in her eyes was unmistakable. But
she shook her head and refused the impulse his roughness,
his downright rudeness had stirred in her. Somehow
she always found it easy to make excuse for him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span></p>

<p>“The same. Always the same,” she said impatiently,
for all the smile she forced herself to. “Some day,
Ivor, you’ll wake up and wonder the reason you were
built with a rough tongue and a foolish grouch.”</p>

<p>The man glanced quickly at the sky. Then he indicated
the main hatch where he had been squatting
and led the way towards it. He seated himself and
left the girl standing. And promptly seized on the
opening she had given him, and sought to drive home
his purpose. At all costs he must get her away before&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>“There’s times when a rough tongue’s needed.
When a grouch is surely dead right,” he said, without
any softening. “Is it right for women to give way to
a sort of low curiosity to look into the trouble and
bad luck helpless folk are up against? You came for
that, Claire,” he said deliberately; “it was a swell drive
out of Beacon to pass an idle time. I kind of wouldn’t
have thought it of you.”</p>

<p>It was one of those moments when the engineer felt
that somehow he ought to have done better. He
wanted to drive this girl away. And on the spur of
the moment it was the only thing he could think of.
He wanted to get her off that vessel without explanation.
And so he designed to anger her as the simplest,
most direct method of achieving his purpose.</p>

<p>But the whole thing missed fire for the reason that
Claire was shrewd, and knew him, and because her
reason for coming was something which had far deeper
object than the idle curiosity of which he accused her.</p>

<p>The blaze of anger he had expected was not forthcoming.
Claire’s colour heightened, and her soft blue
eyes were less wide as she gazed down into his plain,
unsmiling face. Then the corners of her mouth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
dropped. And somehow her whole expression suggested
distress to the man who so absolutely worshipped
her. She shook her head slowly.</p>

<p>“Not curiosity, Ivor,” she said. “Not that.” Then
a shadowy smile lit her eyes. “And as for the swell
drive to pass an idle time, I’d have said you knew the
Beacon trail better than that. If you don’t, why, just
ask Mum, and get a look at the tires of our automobile.
If you’d had some one you guessed the sun rose and
set in who was travelling home to you in a ship that’s
never been heard of since she handed out an S.O.S.,
why, it seems to me you’d feel like chasing the ends
of the earth to get a look at any old wreck that blew
in on to the rocks from Australia to the Arctic. Curiosity?”
she cried scornfully. “Well, you can call it
that way if you fancy it. I’m here because I couldn’t
live with peace in my mind till I knew this boat wasn’t
the one that should have brought our Jim back to us.”</p>

<p>The girl’s reply drove a wave of contrition surging
through the man’s heart. He felt as though he had
struck her a blow in the face. He felt as though he
wanted to flee before the gentle reproach he interpreted
in the look in her half-smiling eyes. And
yet&mdash;&mdash; He glanced uneasily up at the sky.</p>

<p>“Your Jim’s ship was the <i>Imperial</i> of Bristol,
Claire. You told me that months back,” he expostulated.
“This is the <i>Limpet</i> of Boston. Your Jim
wouldn’t have been aboard a coaster like this. Beating
it from Australia he’d have been on a swell ocean-going
vessel. Goodchurch knew all about this wreck. You
must have got its name. I’d handed him the story
myself and all the details. He should have told you
and saved you from the Beacon trail. Say, little girl,
I’m sorry I handed you that. I didn’t think, or&mdash;&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
You see, I know all your brother meant to you. We’ve
talked about it, you and me, and maybe I ought to have
guessed right away when I saw your dandy face peeking
over that darn old rail.”</p>

<p>Again he looked anxiously up at the sky as a crack
of the tattered sails warned him that the breeze was
springing up with the flood tide.</p>

<p>“But I just tell you we daresn’t stop around here.
You don’t know this bay like Sasa and I do. The tide’s
setting in, and in a few minutes ther’ll be no getting
off these rocks in Sasa’s boat or any other. It’s the
most devilish place in the world. It was that current
that caught and drove this poor blamed barge high and
dry. We must get away right&mdash;&mdash; Eh?”</p>

<p>The girl had suddenly reached out a pointing finger.
She had clutched his arm violently.</p>

<p>“My God! What’s&mdash;that?”</p>

<p>The cry broke from her in a low, almost inarticulate
fashion. She was standing facing down the deck, her
horrified gaze fixed on a spot on the deck in line with
the canvas-sheathed winch. Her face had blanched to
ashen whiteness, and the arm held out pointing was
shaking like an aspen.</p>

<p>McLagan was on his feet beside her, and somehow
her clutching hand had fallen into one of his. He held
it tightly as he, too, gazed down the deck in the beam
of sunlight which had broken through the haze of
cloud which the breeze had stirred.</p>

<p>“What do you see?” he cried quickly, in a low, suppressed
tone. “Tell me, Claire. I want to know. I
can see it, too. But I want to know the thing you see.”</p>

<p>“It’s&mdash;it’s the shadow&mdash;of a man. See?” The girl
was staring straight in front of her and her voice was
faltering. But the arm she still held out had steadied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
under the influence of McLagan’s presence and touch.
“Oh,” she went on, with a gasp. “He’s coming towards
us. I&mdash;I can’t stand it. He’s big, too, and&mdash;and&mdash;Oh,
God!&mdash;for pity’s sake, Ivor, take me away&mdash;take
me away!”</p>

<p>But the man made no attempt to obey her. Instead
his words came gently and full of confidence and encouragement.</p>

<p>“Stand your ground, little girl,” he urged. “Quit
your scare. I’m right here, and nothing’s going to do
you hurt. It was this I was trying to save you from.
The sight of it. It’ll pass with the sun. It’s just a
queer shadow, and doesn’t mean a thing&mdash;to hurt. I’ve
seen it before, and know about it. It’s the sun makes
us see it. But it’s queer. It hasn’t a thing to do with
the gear above. Look. Its outline’s in the air. An’
its shadow’s on the deck. See? It’s the outline of a
man, a big man. He’s carrying something in two
hands. You can’t see what it is. You can’t see any
face. Just an outline. And he’s walking this way
and don’t come any nearer. Isn’t it queer? What is
it? A spook, or&mdash;or a trick of the sun? Say, it’s
queer. Ah!” He drew a deep breath. “Look, it’s
fading out. It’s going with the sun. Look! That’s
better. Now&mdash;now it’s gone.”</p>

<p>The sun had suddenly passed behind the clouds again.
And as it did so the shadow had completely disappeared.</p>

<p>Claire drew a deep sigh. On the instant the man’s
arm was flung out to her support. But it was unnecessary.
For all the ghastly hue of her cheeks, the utter
pallor of her lips, the girl was not of the fainting sort.
He watched the slow return of her colour with anxious,
troubled eyes.</p>

<p>Suddenly she spoke. Her eyes were still on the spot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
where the terrifying shadow had moved so meaninglessly.</p>

<p>“Let’s&mdash;let’s get away, Ivor,” she said, in a low,
hushed tone. “It&mdash;it was a ghost&mdash;a&mdash;I&mdash;I&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>McLagan resorted to the only thing his mind suggested.
He laughed. He felt it was the only thing in
face of the girl’s condition.</p>

<p>“I guess it’s a mighty harmless spook, anyway,” he
said lightly. “The poor darn thing’s pinned right down
to that spot. He hasn’t moved a yard since I first
located him days back. But maybe you’re right though,
kid. There’s no sort of use standing around gawking
at a fool spectre that hasn’t sense but to stand around
waiting to show himself when the sun shines. He
ought to know better. Moonlight’s his playtime. Yes,
come right along, and we’ll beat it back to your Mum.”</p>

<p>For all the man’s banter he hurried the girl down the
deck, carefully avoiding the spot where the shadow had
stood. They stood for a moment at the down-haul
cleats, and Claire looked back over the deck. She felt
safer here. There was McLagan, big and smiling.
And there, beside her, was the means of retreat.</p>

<p>“I guess I’m not brave, Ivor,” she smiled a little
pathetically. “When it comes to that sort of thing I’m
like dead mutton. I’m not scared of a thing living.
But the dead&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Dead?”</p>

<p>Claire nodded.</p>

<p>“Sure. Some one was killed right there. A big man.
Do you wonder this vessel blew right in here without
a soul on board? I don’t.”</p>

<p>She turned to the rail, and the man moved to her
assistance.</p>

<p>“Can you manage that ladder, Claire?” He had no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
comment to offer concerning her summing up of the
thing they had both witnessed. His only desire at the
moment was her safe departure from the mystery boat
and its haunting. “Can you?” he went on.</p>

<p>Then of a sudden he reached out and caught her
slight body in his arms. In a moment he had lifted her
on to the rail and held her safely while she set her feet
on the rungs of the ladder beyond it. He waited while
she lowered herself step by step. He was still holding
her warm, soft hands firmly in his when her now smiling
thankful eyes came on a level with his.</p>

<p>“It’s all right, Ivor,” she nodded. “Guess I’m safe
now. But, but you’re strong lifting me that way.
You’re coming right along down, too.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” he said. “Sure I am.” For an instant the
blood surged to his head. The pretty eyes, the sweet
face were so near, so very near to his. But slowly it
receded, and, as the girl passed below the rail, McLagan
drew a deep breath. He turned abruptly. His gaze
was down the deck where the shadow had been. Then
he glanced at the sky. The next moment he passed
over the ship’s rail and followed the girl.</p>

<span class="fs95">The Man from the Hills</span></h2>


<p class="drop-capy1">THE labour of it was tremendous. The sturdy
ponies were a-lather with sweat in the pleasant
warmth of the summer day. Their burden ordinarily
was sufficiently light. A rattling, aged buckboard
driven by the man they had known for nearly five
years. It contained no outfit, no burden of any sort
but the reckless teamster who had literally made the
trail by his own many journeys between his home
and the city of Beacon Glory. But it was the final
stage of the journey. A heart-bursting haul up an
incline steeper than one in four.</p>

<p>At the summit were rest and feed in plenty. Unlike
other men in the region using horse labour, McLagan
cared for his ponies better than he would care for
himself. He worked them to the limit if need be,
but his care of them was the same. In his undemonstrative,
unsentimental fashion he loved his shaggy,
stocky Alaskan ponies, and saw to it that they knew
it in the fashion they understood.</p>

<p>Already the crowning plateau of his home was in
view through the gaunt arms of the tattered forest trees
with which the track was lined. A hundred yards or
so more and the labour of it would be over, and the
ardent creatures would snuff the ocean breeze in their
gushing nostrils. The man’s whip lay gently playing
over the ponies’ backs, urgent for their last ounce of
effort. He was leaning forward on the hard sprung<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
seat as though to spare them weight. It was an instinctive
attitude that was of no real help. It was the
attitude of a man accustomed to the saddle.</p>

<p>McLagan was more urgent for his home just now
than usual. He had gone into Beacon to meet the
message he expected from his partners and employers.
But that had been excuse. He had, in reality, made
the journey for Claire Carver and her mother. On
their return from the wreck in the bay they had
discovered the girl’s mother in a state of panic. The
automobile had been put completely out of action by
the terrible road over which it had passed. Not a
single one of its tires was standing up. The mother
was helpless. The girl was in little better case. And
McLagan did what he could in the way of repair. But
it was quite useless. The outer covers were wrecked,
and incapable of containing the inner tubes.</p>

<p>In the end McLagan was able to impress on them
sufficiently the immediate necessity of himself making
a visit to Beacon. He assured them that he had long
since planned it. That his business was pressing. And
the good luck of it was that his buckboard would just
carry the three of them, if they did not mind being
somewhat packed into the seat and badly jolted. They
had by no means minded. And the older woman sighed
her relief as they planned to have a man sent out with
new tires to fetch in the derelict automobile.</p>

<p>“You know, Claire, girl,” she had said, in her downright
fashion, which no improvement in her fortunes
had been able to modify, “them automobiles is liable to
set folks thinkin’ you’re all sorts of a dame ridin’
around in ’em. But give me a team of decent mountain-bred
plugs, with a bunch of grain inside ’em.
Maybe they ain’t a blue streak of lightnin’, but they’ll<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
mostly get you there an’ haul you back, which it’s a
God’s truth is a thing you can only guess about with
one of these oil cans. Ivor’s wise. Maybe his business
depends on his bein’ there to do it. So he gambles
on these dandy four-legged creatures.”</p>

<p>And she had affectionately patted and stroked the
warm flesh that was ready to help them in their emergency.</p>

<p>The man had had a better reward than he had looked
for. He had found his reply awaiting him at the mail
office. A reply that he had never hoped to get until
the heads of the Mountain Oil Corporation had held
an important meeting. He realised that it must have
been despatched within a day of the receipt of his
report. It was a clear, definite, decided reply such as
pleased him mightily. It was from the chairman of
the Board of Directors.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Complete prospect earliest possible date. Sailing in ten
weeks. Be with you early fall. Make all preparations for
big forward move. Prospect for large territorial concession.
Prepare everything. Big money.”</p></div>

<p>The very brevity of the message was its greatest joy
to McLagan. It was, he felt, the message of a big man
unfettered by any smallness of consideration. His interpretation
of it was no less big. To him it meant
go right ahead, grab all you can, and to hell with the
cost. And the engineer, being the man he was, needed
no further urging. So he had spared his ponies on the
home trail less than usual.</p>

<p>He reached the plateau just as the sunset was at the
height of its glory beyond the bay. The waters were
dead flat, a mirror of liquid fire under the radiant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
light. Even the ugly, iron-bound coast was rendered
something gracious for once in its ruthless existence.</p>

<p>He had planned as he came along, absorbed in the
prospect that lay ahead of him. The whole thing was
quite simple. Everything must be got ready. He must
set out on a big trip round with Peter. They must
make a broad survey. He would set out with Sasa
to join Peter at the camp. He would close up his
shanty and quit it for the summer, or, at least, until
the Directors had completed their inspection. Early
fall. They would be with him in early fall to settle the
final details. That was nearly three months from now.
Yes. He could get everything ready for them by that
time.</p>

<p>Sasa took the hard-blowing team as it drew up at
the log barn, and McLagan walked round the ponies
and helped unhitch them.</p>

<p>“Turn ’em loose, boy,” he said. “Let ’em get a roll,
and feed ’em hay. Don’t water ’em till they cool.
Then set ’em in the barn and push their blankets on.
Feed ’em corn in two hours.”</p>

<p>He passed on to the door of his hut. But he paused
on the way. As he stepped out into the open the wreck
of the <i>Limpet</i> came into his view. In a moment he
had forgotten everything else as the memory of his
last visit to the derelict came back to him.</p>

<p>Somehow the whole episode had been swept out of
his mind by the text of the message he had received
from his own people. It could not have been otherwise
in a man of his temper and purpose. He was at the
threshold of a tremendous achievement which years
of infinite labour had brought to his hand. Peter Loby
was the oil man, the expert creature who dealt in drills,
and pipes, and the immediate localities for his operations.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
But it was McLagan whose knowledge and
vision searched the territory. It was he who had first
realised the possibilities of that black belt of territory
which he had sent Loby to explore. His whole horizon
was bounded by such prospecting, just as Peter’s was
by oil. Yes, the news that these men of finance were
ready to put themselves and their money behind his
work had completely cleared his healthy brain of the
cobwebs which his last visit to the <i>Limpet</i> had woven
there.</p>

<p>Now, however, it was different. Just as the other
had overwhelmed every other consideration, the sight
of the derelict flung memory back upon those things
which are never failing in their grip on human imagination.</p>

<p>He stood gazing down at the queer object and every
vestige of his earlier enthusiasm for the work in hand
faded out of his unsmiling eyes. He had forgotten.
And now he remembered. And so he stood there, for
all he was ready enough for the cooking food which
Sasa had prepared, and which smelt so appetising on
the still air.</p>

<p>The sun sank lower upon the horizon. It dipped into
the sea and lit a broad path across the bosom of the
waters. The circling gulls screamed out their night
chorus before perching for their rest. And all the time,
deeper and more surely, the fascination of that derelict
below took hold of him.</p>

<p>At last McLagan stirred. He unfastened the pea-jacket
it was his habit to wear. Then he raised one
hand and the palm of it was passed across his forehead
thrusting back his cap in its gesture. He turned and
called over his shoulder.</p>

<p>“Sasa!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span></p>

<p>The half-breed came sturdily across to him from
behind the hut. And he stood there beside him following
the direction of his gaze till his own rested upon
the remains of the <i>Limpet</i>.</p>

<p>“Your canoe. Your kyak. Is she in good shape?”</p>

<p>“Sure. Him all time same. I mak him so.”</p>

<p>“You’ll beat it up the river to-night. Get it?”</p>

<p>The dark-skinned creature looked up into the face of
his boss. Then he turned away, for the white man was
still gazing at the wreck below.</p>

<p>“You’ll beat it up the river and fetch Mr. Loby
right down here. You’ll beat it quick. You’ll tell him
to have an outfit ready at the camp to go into the
hills. He’ll know just what I mean. But he’s to come
right&mdash;No. I’ll write it. I’ll give you a ‘brief’ to
take to Mr. Loby. It’s nearly low water now. You
can ride up on the tide.”</p>

<p>He turned to pass into the hut. But the half-breed
detained him.</p>

<p>“Boss, you think dat ship all time. Yes, I know.
I see him in your eye. Dam’ ship no good. Bad. I
go, yes. You not go by dam’ ship with no man? You
not go? No? It bad. So bad.”</p>

<p>The man’s tone was almost beseeching.</p>

<p>“You’re a damned coward, Sasa, as I told you before,”
McLagan laughed as he turned away. “You’re
a damned coward about everything but the big water.
You get busy right away. You’ve got to have Mr.
Loby down here early to-morrow. I’ll write that brief
for you.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The Alsek River had none of the greatness or splendour
of its southern neighbour, the Lias. But then it
flowed through a far different territory as it approached<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
its mouth. Its lower reaches were marsh and tundra-bounded.
It was a deep, sluggish channel occupying
the lowest level in the heart of a wide muskeg, some
thirty or forty miles in extent. Higher up, however,
amidst the great hills, where lay the camp of the Mountain
Oil Corporation, it lacked nothing of the scenic
beauty of the hundreds of mountain creeks and rivers
which scored the coast territory of the Alaskan Hills.
In spring, under the fierce freshets, it was a roaring,
blustering watercourse without mercy for any obstructions
in its path. In summer it was a shallow, shoaly
stream of guile and treachery.</p>

<p>Cy Liskard regretted the river he had made his own
as his light craft passed out of the hill country and
entered upon the flat of muskeg, which would continue
until the barrier hills of the coast were reached. The
Alsek River was not only ugly to him. It was a good
deal more. He knew that the vivid, brilliant green of
this limitless plain was one of Nature’s vilest snares.
It was one vast, treeless swamp, thinly disguised by an
alkali crust, and as bottomless as only a northern
muskeg can be. It was without life, animal or human.
Only was it swarming with wildfowl for whom it
was a never-failing refuge from trap and gun.</p>

<p>But he laboured indefatigably. He was running
with the stream, his muscles at ease, but with mind and
eye alert and uneasy. He knew the dangers of this
dreary channel. It was deep enough. Oh, yes. He
knew that. At times it was monstrously deep. But
its sodden, reed-grown banks yielded no footing for
landing; there were mud banks dotted throughout its
course; and in its open channels masses of submerged
weed flourished abundantly. So his vigilance was unceasing,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
and he drove a course whose constant zig-zag
suggested incompetence.</p>

<p>But there was no incompetence in Cy Liskard on
the water. He travelled swiftly and without doubt or
hesitation. For he meant to reach those distant coast
hills with the last of the tide, driven hard by that which
lay back of his mind.</p>

<p>His search for his quarry about the oil camp in
the hills had been fruitless. He had prosecuted it with
infinite determination. He had lain cached when he
encountered McLagan’s river men. He had well and
truly covered his tracks, when at night he had reconnoitred
the camp itself. Then, when he had ascertained
beyond all possibility of doubt that the man he sought
was not at the camp, he had passed on all undetected,
unsuspected. Now he was on the last stages of his
journey to the coast. The coast and that crazy, high-perched
shanty overlooking the bay.</p>

<p>Cy Liskard betrayed no outward sign. He looked to
belong to the long trail of the wilderness whose peace
and calm his soulless eyes expressed so well. His outfit
looked to be the outfit of those who live by trap and
gun, and the protruding muzzle of a modern rifle over
the curved bows of his craft increased the illusion. But
his purpose was no less for these things. Perhaps,
even, it was the contrary.</p>

<p>The miles passed rapidly behind him. They drifted
away on a winding course that flashed and gleamed in
the brilliant summer daylight. But for all his speed,
the outlook seemed to remain the same, the distant hills
to come no nearer.</p>

<p>But they were approaching very rapidly. And, as the
late afternoon ripened the sparkle of earlier day, at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
last they rose abruptly till their height seemed to overwhelm
the monotonous level of the muskeg.</p>

<p>Now the watchful eyes became less watchful. The
need was less. The level, sodden banks had given place
to sharp-cut, solid granite, and the widened stream
had slackened and given place to deep, clear water free
of all hidden traps. A sense of ease and safety permitted
the man’s attention to wander to that which lay
ahead and about him.</p>

<p>The river bent sharply away to the right behind the
first of the foothills and doubled its breadth. Farther
on was a leftward sweep, and as he approached it he
realised that he no longer had the river to himself. A
canoe&mdash;an Eskimo kyak&mdash;had swung round the far
bend, on the outer circle of it, and was driving like an
arrow against the sluggish stream.</p>

<p>Just for an instant there was hesitation, and the dip
of Cy Liskard’s paddle was less unruffled. Then, seemingly,
the man’s doubt passed and he kept straight on.
He made no attempt to hail the stranger. He never
even permitted his gaze to turn in his direction. But
nothing escaped the search of his pale eyes.</p>

<p>He had recognised the man in the kyak for what he
was. He had seen him before. Something of an
Eskimo or Indian. A sturdy, squat figure, with broad,
fleshy shoulders and lank black hair, and eyes that
might have been the folds of a crease in the flesh of
his ugly face had it not been for the deep sockets in
which they were set.</p>

<p>Oh, yes. He had seen him before, and he let him
pass him without word or greeting.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The mouth of the Alsek River from the land side
was a curious and interesting effect of erosion. Even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
granite, that almost invincible barrier which Nature
sets up against the onslaught of her own fierce elements,
had ultimately yielded. The river on the one
side and the storming seas on the other had beaten upon
the granite anvil till the white flag of surrender had
been hoisted.</p>

<p>The attacking elements had met through a narrow
gap which had helped to set the scene for the appalling
race of tide which swept in through it. Two gaunt,
barren headlands stood sentry on either side with less
than three hundred yards of water dividing them.
Outside these lay the bay with its guarding headlands
and a multitude of rocky warriors still defending. Inside
was an expanse of water that was nearly a mile
wide. This was no less rockbound than the outer bay,
but it was completely sheltered so that no view of the
bay beyond could be obtained except that which was
visible through the narrow opening.</p>

<p>It was early morning. The sun had just lifted above
the eastern hills. Nature was astir. The restless sea-fowl
were breaking their fast upon such fare as the
waters provided, and sunrise had brought up with it a
freshening breeze. The night tide was rapidly running
out and the race of water was still fierce and strong
and threatening.</p>

<p>Cy Liskard was laboriously clambering along the
foreshore of the inner cove. He was moving up
towards the headland guarding the southern shore of
the river mouth. He was searching for the most promising
direction whence he could attack its lofty summit.</p>

<p>Such was the nature of the shore that his movements
were largely hidden. It was the thing he desired most.
Now he was passing along in the shadow of mountainous
boulders. Now he was full in the open, scaling a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
barrier impossible otherwise to pass. But he was making
progress, rapid progress onwards and upwards. He
had swiftly realised the danger of passing the gateway
on the open water. It would have been to court discovery
on the instant, to say nothing of the chances of
disaster from the race of the tide, so his boat lay
cached behind him while he confronted the task of
scaling the headland.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The man was standing on the windswept crest of the
southern guardian of the river. He was sheltering
from observation behind a boulder, and from the whip
of the breeze which stung with a wintry bite. The
whole of the great bay lay there below him, calm and
peaceful, and completely inviting. He was gazing
down upon it, but without regard for its austere beauty.
For that he had no interest whatever. The ravishing
shimmer of the summer waters, the tattered magnificence
of the element’s aged battle-ground. These
things were matters of complete indifference to him.
Even his view of McLagan’s high-perched home for
the moment seemed to make no claim.</p>

<p>His searching gaze was preoccupied with the thing
he had never looked to discover. He was gazing down
upon the wreck of the <i>Limpet</i> lying upon its deathbed
of rocks, which the night ebb had left bare. He
was studying it, searching it, shape and rig and every
detail as might some sailorman who still retains all
his interest for a calling he has long since abandoned.</p>

<p>For a long time he stood in the shelter of the boulder,
and the fascination of the wreck held him until its spell
was abruptly broken by a thing of more immediate consequence.
Suddenly he became aware of a small boat
making its way from the north shore in the direction<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
of the wreck. And in a moment he understood. He
raised his eyes to the house on the cliffs. He dropped
them again to the beach below. Then they came again
to the moving boat with its solitary occupant.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Cy Liskard had made the great descent. Now he
was standing in the shadow of the vessel lying upon
the rocks, gazing up at the lettering of her name on her
bluff bows. Some distance away behind him lay an
empty dinghy hauled clear of the lapping waters.</p>

<p>The man had approached the vessel in a mood that
was sheerly exulting. Here, undoubtedly, was his goal
at last. It was a different goal from that which he
had expected. But that was of no consequence. He
had watched the dinghy behind him approach the rocks.
He had seen the man leap out of it and haul it clear of
the water. Then he had seen him approach the derelict
and climb on board it. There was no mistake. He had
recognised that tall, powerful figure on the instant. It
was impossible for him to mistake it, even though it
had been clad differently that night at the Speedway.
He felt that he had his man in a trap, and it was a
trap from which he had no intention of letting him
escape.</p>

<p>There was a curious look in his pale eyes as he stared
up at the vessel’s name. For once they had been stirred
out of their customary expressionlessness. There was
something almost like a smile in them. But it was
shadowy. It was of the vaguest. And it only contrived
to transform them into something tigerish.</p>

<p>At last he turned away, and as he did so a harsh
sound broke from his lips. It might have been a short,
hard laugh, only that not a muscle of his face had
stirred. He moved slowly down the vessel’s length<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
till he came to the rope ladder amidships. Then he
paused. He thrust one hand into the pocket of his
closely-buttoned pea-jacket and produced a heavy
pistol. It was an automatic, and he examined its loading
carefully. Then, with a hunching movement of
his broad shoulders and a quick, frowning upward
glance at the blazing sun, he seized the rope ladder
and set foot on its bottom rung.</p>

<span class="fs95">The Lazaret</span></h2>


<p class="drop-capy1">THE last of the daylight had only just passed.
It was nearing midnight, and the sky was clear
and with every moment the night lights of the heavens
were gaining power. Already a moving belt of Northern
Lights had made its spectre-like appearance above
the horizon, and the rare, clear atmosphere was ideal
for their perfect development.</p>

<p>It was a wide flat in the hills something removed
from the highway of the Alsek River, and, dotted
about it, were the shadowy outlines of box-like human
habitations, and the litter of a wide-flung oil camp.
Here and there could clearly be seen the upstanding
machinery of the drills with which the earth’s bosom
had already been pierced.</p>

<p>It was in the doorway of one of the shanties that
the lean figure of Peter Loby was lounging. He was
only partly dressed. He had been suddenly roused
from his blankets, with only sufficient time to haul on
a pair of earth-stained, moleskin trousers. His first
keen resentment at the breaking of his night’s rest had
passed. He had completed the reading of the brief note
which had promptly been thrust into his hands; but his
manner still remained short enough.</p>

<p>“What in hell made you push this at me now, Sasa?”
he protested. “We can’t start down that darn river
till daylight, anyway. We need all the light if we’re
to get through the muskeg bottom right. What’s keeping<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
McLagan down there? Seems to me it’s dead waste
me going down to the coast only to make back again.”</p>

<p>His resentful gaze took in the sturdy figure of the
half-breed. But his words were rather an angry expression
of his feelings than an invitation to the messenger
to attempt explanation. Sasa Mannik, however,
took the white man literally.</p>

<p>“I do as boss McLagan say,” he replied, in his halting
fashion. “He say, ‘I mak this brief. You give it
boss Loby right away; then you bring him right down
quick. Early to-morrow.’ We mak him trip right
now? Then you speak boss McLagan early to-morrow.
The muskeg nothing. Not nothing. I know dis
thing sure. You mak fix all thing now? Yes?”</p>

<p>The half-breed’s urgency was something more than
his orders suggested. His eyes were wider than their
wont. Altogether the man seemed to Peter to be disturbed.</p>

<p>“What is it, Sasa?” Peter’s manner was less irritated.
Something he saw in the coloured man’s eyes
left him curious. “Has anything happened that your
boss hasn’t set in this letter?”</p>

<p>The half-breed looked away behind him in the direction
of the faintly outlined hill behind which lay the
river where his treasured kyak was securely cached.
It was a native mannerism of unease.</p>

<p>“I not know the thing that ‘brief’ say,” he said
evasively, after a moment’s thought. “Oh, no. You
tell me, then I know. I not read the thing boss McLagan
mak. I know all thing I see. I know all thing
white man do. Oh, yes. The boss say I bring you
down quick. I mak that. It good, too, yes?”</p>

<p>“What d’you mean?”</p>

<p>Peter was studying the dark face intently.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span></p>

<p>“I think it good you come&mdash;quick.”</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>The half-breed shrugged. Then his hands moved in
an expressive gesture.</p>

<p>“One thing. Two thing. I mak think it good you
come quick,” he said. “Boss McLagan go by big ship.
All the devil mans get him, sure. Plenty devil mans by
big ship. I know. I see him. Him call boss all time
so he go crazy, sure. Boss look at him ship. He hear
him call. All time call. So boss mak forget all thing.
Him mak this trip with me this night? Oh, no. Devil
man call him quick. Him listen. It not good. Boss
go right down by big ship, so devil man kill him all
up. Sure. One thing.”</p>

<p>The worried man raised a lean, dark finger to count
the item. Then he raised a second finger beside the
first.</p>

<p>“Two thing,” he went on. And now the widening
of his eyes lessened. They closed to slits from which
all his superstitious awe had passed. “I not know
this two thing sure,” he said thoughtfully. “I just
think him. I mak up dis river. I meet canoe. I see
dis man, I tell you an’ boss McLagan. Him dis man
I see one time, two time, by the coast. Him go down
river. I come right here. What him mak go down
river I not guess. He bad man. Much bad. I see
him eye look all time bad. Him eye lak devilfish. Oh,
yes. Bad. Why him go down river? I not know.
Him look all time for some thing. I not know. You
mak this trip right now, quick. Then we mak him
coast so quick this bad man not know us there. No.”
He pointed in a low easterly direction. “Him sun by
that place, then us with boss McLagan sure. I go lak
hell quick.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span></p>

<p>Peter Loby wanted to laugh at the simple earnestness
of this creature whose benighted mind was so full
of the spectres his forbears had bred into it. He
wanted to deride out of his superiority and enlightenment.
But somehow he refrained from doing so.</p>

<p>“You say you don’t know this man? Yet you’re
plumb sure he’s bad? Why?” he asked sharply.</p>

<p>Sasa’s gesture was full of profound contempt for
the limitations of these “crazy white men.”</p>

<p>“You shoot up fox. You shoot up wolf,” he said.
“You not eat him. Why? Him good meat, sure.
White man not eat him. Eskimo not eat him&mdash;only
when he starve. So. You see good man. You say
‘good’! You see bad man. You say ‘bad’! Why?
All man do much thing him not know why. Why?”
The brown finger was raised again, and it tapped the
man’s broad low forehead with its stubby tip. “It
here. This man bad. So bad. I say him. You come
quick.”</p>

<p>Peter nodded.</p>

<p>“All right. Get right back to your boat, Sasa,” he
said resignedly. “Get her all ready. I’ll be along
right away. How’ll the tide serve down below?”</p>

<p>“Him good. We mak him in dead water,” Sasa
said, with a quick, ready nod. His air of relief at
having persuaded the white man was almost child-like.
“I go mak ready right away. I mak dis trip so
dam’ quick.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Ivor McLagan stared about him in the feeble light
of his hurricane lantern. It was the lazaret of the
<i>Limpet</i>. A smallish apartment between decks, with
an entrance through a trap in the deck above, which
was also the floor of the steward’s pantry. He had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
just descended the ladder and stood gazing upon the
iron tanks with their tightly screwed-down manholes.</p>

<p>The place contained four of these. Their purpose
was obvious enough even to his landsman’s mind.
They were food containers for biscuit and flour, and
such supplies as must be kept safe from the rats with
which the vessel had swarmed.</p>

<p>But the place contained other things besides. There
were packing cases, and chests of various sizes littered
about all round him. There were barrels, too,
which he shrewdly suspected contained salted meat,
beef and pork. Some of the chests were empty. Some
were still nailed fast. Each of the barrels was obviously
as it had been originally shipped and stowed.</p>

<p>He stood there for some contemplative moments.
He had come there to search this place thoroughly as
he intended to search the rest of the vessel. But he
had discovered this storage of food supplies quite
accidentally, and with no suspicion of its existence.
It is even doubtful if he had ever heard of a ship’s
lazaret. While examining the steward’s pantry above
he had observed the trap in the deck, and forthwith
had proceeded with his investigations.</p>

<p>Now he was considering the best means of examination.
A shaft of daylight came down through the trap
above him and he had his lantern. But the double resource
left the place ill-lit and difficult. After awhile
he found an iron hook suspended from the deck above,
and promptly availed himself of it. He hung his lantern
thereon and instantly appreciated the added illumination
so gained. He moved slowly amongst the
litter. Right at his feet lay two chests of stout make.
They were different from the rest scattered about.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
They were iron-bound and of dark, heavy wood. Their
iron bonds had been cut and the lids thrown back, and
they were quite empty. He bent down over these and
examined the lids closely. There was no stencilling
upon them to give any clue to their source. There
was no address of any sort.</p>

<p>He left them, passing on to the rest in deliberate
and careful succession. He had made up his mind
that nothing should remain unexamined. For, he
argued, here were the ship’s stores, and these stores
might give him some clue as to whence they came.
An address. A purveyor’s business name. Anything
and everything of such a nature might surely help
materially in solving the mystery that so profoundly
intrigued him.</p>

<p>For a while his search was unproductive of information,
although, in another direction it was not without
interest. Each chest he had discovered had had <em>all
markings carefully erased with a scraper</em>. Why?</p>

<p>It was a curious discovery. It was deeply significant.
To McLagan’s acute mind there was but a single
answer. The whole thing suggested secrecy. Again
why? After turning over the last chest he stood up
and gazed about him, and, in the stuffy heat of the
place, he passed a hand across his sweating forehead.
But his gesture was in reality one of perplexity and
had no relation to the heat. Clearly there was only
one thing to be done. After he had explored the sealed
tanks he must examine the contents of those cases
that still remained full. They might contain canned
fruit or milk. Anyway, something which would
clearly tell him its source.</p>

<p>Yes. He would first unseal those tanks, and essay
the negotiation of those narrow manholes. Then&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span></p>

<p>He had started to cross over to the nearest tank
when his eyes chanced upon a portion of an old packing
case lying in an obscure corner. There was a square
of white upon it. In the doubtful light he could not
be certain what the latter was. But it looked like the
thing for which he had been so long searching. It
looked like an address ticket. He stooped and picked
it up.</p>

<p>It was the thing he hoped. But&mdash;&mdash; In his profound
amazement he found himself muttering the address
upon it aloud.</p>

<p>“Capt. Julian Caspar, Sailing Ship, <i>Imperial</i> of
Bristol, Perth, Western Australia.”</p>

<p>At the bottom of the address card was the name of
a firm of wine merchants in “Perth, W.A.,” and at
the top of it, in block lettering, was the usual “With
Care.”</p>

<p>He stood gazing at it for a long time. His thought
was travelling rapidly. In a moment he had realised
that this piece of wood belonged to none of the open
cases he had examined. It was probably something
left over from some previous voyage, and, remaining
in its corner, had so escaped the careful obliteration
of address and markings to which the remainder of the
stores had been submitted.</p>

<p>But the name of the ship on the address startled
him beyond words. <i>Imperial</i> of Bristol. It was
the name of the ship in which Claire’s brother Jim
had set sail for home. How came it on board the
<i>Limpet</i> of Boston?</p>

<p>Again came that gesture of perplexity. Then of a
sudden his eyes lit. He moved directly under the
lantern and read again the address on the card. This
time he spelt the name of the ship over quite slowly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
and aloud. Then he began another spelling and it
was the name of the wreck itself.</p>

<p>“<em>L-I-M-P-E-T</em>,” he muttered. Then after a pause:
“<em>I-M-P-E</em>. Yes. Then ther’s the <em>L.</em> sure. Boston.
Bristol. Gee! Looks like it’s&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>He broke off with a startled upward glance in the
direction of the hatch above. Just for an instant he
remained listening acutely. Then he dropped the wood
from his hands and it fell with a clatter on the deck
at his feet. He reached up and snatched the lantern
from the hook and extinguished it. There was a
sound. It was the faint stealing sound as of some one
cautiously approaching along the deck above him.</p>

<p>Who could it be? Loby? Sasa? No. He had no
expectation of their return till afternoon. Claire?
He remembered Claire’s unexpected visit. She was
not likely to repeat it. It would not be Claire. No.
Who then? He remembered the ghostly shadow that
had terrified Claire and the half-breed. And, for the
first time in his life, he experienced that thrill of the
nerves which the uncanny rarely fails to inspire even
in the hardiest.</p>

<p>Then came the full and unpleasant realisation of his
position. One glance round him in the twilight warned
him of his disadvantage. Here, in the lazaret, he was
like a rat in a trap. He had no idea of who it could
be above. But that which his senses had told him left
him with a feeling of detestation for such a position.
He turned promptly to the iron ladder.</p>

<p>“You’re covered, McLagan. You’re covered sure
as death. The moment you show your darn head
above that hole I’ll blow it plumb to small meat.”</p>

<p>McLagan drew back. There was no thrill of the
nerves in him now. It was not the uncanny that held<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
him. He knew that voice on the instant. It was the
voice of Cy Liskard. And he understood that the
man had a score to settle with him, and had come to
settle it.</p>

<p>His position was desperate. He was armed. His
automatic was fully loaded. But it was useless. Quite
useless. For the man above had not shown himself
in the aperture of the trap.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The man from the hills was standing in the cabin
alleyway with his back to the main deck. He was
facing the door of the steward’s pantry with a clear
view of the open trap of the lazaret. But he, himself,
was sufficiently clear of it to stand in no risk of gun-fire
on the part of the man he had trapped there. His
gun was ready in his hand. No man could hope to
ascend the ladder of the lazaret and get the first shot
in. He knew that. And, for the moment, was quite
content. Now he was talking, and a curious light
had replaced the deadness usually looking out of his
eyes.</p>

<p>“I didn’t guess to find you here, McLagan,” he
said. “I didn’t think to find this wreck lying around.
But I’ve come many miles to find you, and pay the
thing I owe you. I humped it into Beacon to buy a
‘time.’ I was out to buy it in a fashion you oil folks
don’t guess about. I was there to pay for it in dollars
an’ dollars, and all sorts of gold you never dreamt
about; I wanted that dame, and you jumped in and
smashed my face. It ain’t that smash I’m worrying
about&mdash;though I owe you for that. But you cost me
that dame an’ darn near a hangin’. That’s what I’m
here to pay you for. An’ pay you good. I’m goin’
to kill you right here. Savvy? An’ I guess it’s a good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
place to get away with it right. They’ll find you lying
around dead, an’ it’ll take all the United States lawyers
to guess who did it. I don’t belong this location. I
ain’t within miles of it. Ther’s no one who counts
knows I’m around. I guess ther’ ain’t a soul to disturb
us. You see, your folks are up the river, an’
you&mdash;I saw you come along over to this darn wreck.
Do you feel like showing yourself, or will I seal up
this hatch an’ fire the ship?”</p>

<p>The man spoke very deliberately. He spoke without
passion. His manner was quietly confident and satisfied.</p>

<p>For a moment he contemplated the raised trap as
though measuring his chances of carrying out his final
threat. Not for a moment did he imagine his victim
would be unarmed. He remembered the Speedway.
McLagan had been armed then. He had reason enough
to remember something of the calibre of the weapon
the man had thrust at him.</p>

<p>His eyes turned again to the aperture in the deck.
Did he know the construction of that narrow lazaret
below? It seemed doubtful. And yet it was impossible
to tell.</p>

<p>After awhile his voice came again harshly taunting.</p>

<p>“You ain’t makin’ a lot of fuss, McLagan,” he cried.
“But then you ain’t got a crowd around. You’re on
your own, and don’t feel sure about things. You ken
come right up if you fancy, an’ I’ll give it you fair.
I won’t send you glorywards till your face has had a
peek around at the good daylight you’re goin’ to lose
quick. If you ain’t game for that I’ll sure have to
batten down, an’ start that fire. This vessel’s loaded
down with an elegant cargo of good spruce an’ stuff.
It’ll burn so ther’ ain’t a living soul could get near<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
it. Then her bulkheads are steel, I guess. Gee! What
a dandy oven that lazaret’ll make.”</p>

<p>Still no sound came up from below. Still the engineer
gave no sign. And yet he must surely have
realised the desperateness of his case.</p>

<p>Cy Liskard shifted his position. He was listening
acutely. For all his taunting he was left guessing
while his intended victim remained soundless. He
was thinking very hard. He was puzzled. Suddenly
he raised his gun and looked over its sight. And on
the instant a shot rang out. But it came from the
lazaret and not from his weapon. A bullet struck the
alleyway wall with a spat. It ricochetted off the steel
and tore screaming past the man’s head. Instantly
Cy’s gun replied and a bullet crashed through one of
the iron tanks below with a boom like a drum beat.</p>

<p>He waited for a return fire sheltered from the pantry
doorway. But none was forthcoming. Then realisation
came to him. There was no means of closing
that trap while the man below still retained a single
shot in his gun. At all costs he must draw his fire.</p>

<p>So he drew nearer. He stood in view of the trap.
It was only while he fired a second shot. Then he
leapt aside under cover as McLagan’s answering shot
rang out. It grazed his passing shoulder with a hot
slither, and the blood surged to his brain. He moved
a step forward and fired again into the depths. And
again McLagan replied. The shot only missed Liskard
by inches and the man uttered a sound like a
laugh. It was the engineer’s third shot, and he was
more than satisfied. A few more. Only a few more.</p>

<p>He stood ready. He darted in and fired again
through the trap. Again came McLagan’s retort which
took him in the cloth arm of the thick pea-jacket covering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
his body. He sprang clear. And suddenly a
furious oath broke chokingly from his almost stifled
throat. An arm had caught him from behind encircling
his bull-like neck. There was a brief struggle
while he tried to turn his weapon on the unexpected
assailant. Then he crashed to the deck undermost,
with his gun-arm held and twisted till his hand released
the weapon.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Cy Liskard was standing just clear of the break in
the vessel’s poop. He was beside the main hatch, disarmed,
defeated, but without bonds to hold him prisoner.
Immediately behind him stood Sasa Mannik
who had sworn never to set foot on the wreck again.
And beside him was Peter Loby, lean, grinning, with
a gun in his hand ready for immediate action. At the
head of the alleyway stood Ivor McLagan still handling
his automatic.</p>

<p>He was gazing at the gold man speculatively. Somehow
there was far less resentment than repulsion in his
feeling for this man from the hills, who, but for the
timely arrival of Peter and his servant, would in all
probability have achieved his purpose of cold-blooded
murder. He was a dour, hard-looking creature whose
queer eyes fascinated him. And for the moment he
was wondering at the thing lying back of them.</p>

<p>“Well, what’re you goin’ to do?”</p>

<p>Liskard had stood the victor’s scrutiny in silence as
long as he could.</p>

<p>McLagan laughed derisively at the snarling challenge.</p>

<p>“Do? There’s surely a lot of things I could do,” he
said. “I could have you pitched into that store room,
or lazaret, as I heard you call it, and close it up and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
fire the ship. Her steel bulkheads would make it a
dandy oven. Then ther’s good yards to this craft, for
all her canvas is mostly blown off them, and plenty of
rope. Then I’ve still got haf a clip of cartridges in my
gun and several more in my pockets. I could easy
pass you on glorywards if I fancied that way. But I
don’t.”</p>

<p>A sound came from the half-breed behind the prisoner.
It was a native expression of complete disgust.
Peter only grinned more broadly.</p>

<p>“Ten minutes ago I was yearning to kill as badly
as you,” McLagan went on calmly. “So maybe we’re
fifty-fifty on that. Now I’m not. While I guess you’re
still a hundred per cent that way. I’m going to turn
you free to carry on your pretty work. I don’t feel
like spoiling it by any premature action. You see,
you’ll surely hang one day, and I’d rather it was done
in the regular fashion of the law. You want my
blood, and you haven’t left me guessing why. If you
were a man, and not a brute, I’d say act the sportsman
and take a chance with me. I’d face you just any old
way at any old time. But you prefer the advantage to
be with you all the time. That’s why I’m dead sure
you’ll hang. Now you can get out the way&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>He broke off. A great spread of sunlight had
flashed down on to the deck. Cy Liskard was no
longer heeding him. With the sunshine a queer look
had leapt into his usually expressionless eyes which
were gazing down the deck. Their stare was horrified.
And something like terror had replaced their
deadness. He was staring at a moving shadow. The
shadow that had once sent Sasa headlong over the vessel’s
side and again had driven Claire Carver into
panic.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span></p>

<p>The eyes of both Sasa and Peter Loby were held by
it, too. Only McLagan seemed undisturbed by that
shadowy presence. He was watching the prisoner,
and his gun was still ready.</p>

<p>“You see it, Liskard?” McLagan said, with a derisive
laugh. “We’ve all seen it. And you wanted to
add another haunting to the collection. It’s a big man,
eh? As big as I am. Say, we’d have made a real
dandy pair of spooks, one on the deck and one in the
lazaret&mdash;if you hadn’t burned up the whole darn shooting
match. I wonder who murdered that poor devil
like you’d have murdered me. We’ll never&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>A fierce oath broke from the prisoner. It was more
a cry of real terror than any expression of fury against
the man taunting him. The next moment he was
speeding down the deck, running for the companion-ladder,
while Peter’s gun was levelled at him.</p>

<p>“Quit it, Peter!”</p>

<p>McLagan’s order came on the instant and the man
lowered his weapon.</p>

<p>“Let him go. I want him to go.” Then he turned
to the half-breed. “Over the side with you, boy. You
don’t like spooks, but you can be trusted with men.
You’ve your gun. See to it that darn murdering swine
don’t touch our boats. But don’t dare to kill him up.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>McLagan and Peter were leaning over the vessel’s
rail. Down at the steadily rising water’s edge the half-breed
was standing guard on the boats lying there. In
the direction of the southern headland Cy Liskard was
beating a hasty retreat over the rocks.</p>

<p>“That pretty feller’s got it in for me, Peter, plumb
up to the hilt of his longest and sharpest knife. I guess
he’s a born murderer. And to me his eyes look that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
way. He insulted a woman up at the Speedway, and
I beat him on the face and made a bit of a mess of
him. Then the Aurora boys jumped in on him, and
I can guess the thing that happened. It was hard
letting him make a get-away. But I just couldn’t do
a thing else. Besides, I’ve got a notion it’s best. Say,
boy, I owe you and Sasa more than I’m likely to be
able to pay in a lifetime. How’d you manage to get
around on time?”</p>

<p>McLagan’s thanks were the deeper for the calm
fashion in which they were expressed. Peter nodded
and grinned.</p>

<p>“I’m glad we got around,” he said simply. “I cursed
Sasa for hauling me from my blankets last night, but
I don’t now. He’s queer, that boy. An’, gee, the pace
he drove us down that creek at! You know he had a
notion things were bad. First it was the darn spook
on this ship which worried him. Then he passed a
feller in a canoe, and reckoned he was bad. It was
that guy, and I’d say he was right. He said he was
the feller he’d seen crawling around the rocks at the
mouth of the Lias he told us about once. Yes. He’s
queer. He reckoned that feller was going down that
creek for mischief, and the mischief was against you.
He didn’t know. He just guessed.”</p>

<p>“Well, he guessed right, and”&mdash;McLagan laughed&mdash;“I’ll
have to raise his wages. He’s a good boy.
Say&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>He broke off thoughtfully and Peter waited. After
a moment he turned from the rail.</p>

<p>“I got to get a stout turnscrew, and some tools out
of the carpenter’s shop place.”</p>

<p>“What for?”</p>

<p>They were moving along the deck.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span></p>

<p>“Why, I got a fool notion I’d like to climb over the
stern of this kettle and prise the letters of her name
some. It’s a notion.”</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>McLagan shrugged.</p>

<p>“Just bear a hand, an’ after that I’ve got to go right
into Beacon.”</p>

<p>“But what about our trip?”</p>

<p>Peter was no longer grinning. He was feeling a
little impatient with this chief who could abandon their
all important work for something he felt had no right
to concern him at all.</p>

<p>“Don’t worry a thing, Peter,” McLagan said, recognising
the change in the other’s manner. “I won’t let
you down, boy. It’s not my way. But I’m on a trail
that looks kind of hot to me, and it’s pretty near to
the things that really matter in a man’s life. Get me,
boy? No. You don’t. But it don’t matter. I don’t
ever break my word to a friend. I’m not going to let
you down a thing. Our trip goes through&mdash;but later.”</p>

<p class="drop-capy1">THE full Council of the Aurora Clan was assembled.
The crude accommodation was wholly inadequate.
And many of the members were forced to
stand through lack of sitting room amidst the debris
of the old steam-heat cellar of the ruins of the lakeside
dwelling. But then it was the full Council, and not
the Supreme Executive. And its members numbered
full twenty.</p>

<p>It was sufficiently grotesque for all the significance
lying behind the gathering of these queer figures in
their burlesque robes of white. They represented a
deadly force in the life of this wide-flung northern
country. It was the inevitable reply of those who saw
and appreciated the problems and needs of their own
existence and were prepared to deal with them without
reference to political visions and principles. It
was reaction to pristine instinct.</p>

<p>Yes, it was reaction. The fact of it being a council
had no relation to democratic method. The Aurora
Clan was ruled over by one individual who was called
the “Chief Light of the Aurora.” The Chief Light
was the brain and the driving force. He was the
heart, the soul, and head of the organisation. His
rule was despotic. The councillors were his supporters,
and the executors of his absolute will. They were
possibly, even, advisers, in that they were listened to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
in council. But, bound under oath, they obeyed the
ruling of the Chief Light without question, and under
ruthless penalty.</p>

<p>The Aurora Clan was an expression of passionate
exasperation. It was an expression of men who saw
no hope in the far off councils of self-interested men,
who spend their lives in talk. They wanted their own
corner of the earth made safe for decent democracy,
and were prepared to purge it without regard to the
rest of the world’s opinions. Laws might be enacted
in those far off councils. They would obey them if
they proved adequate in making decent life possible.
If they proved otherwise, in view of the needs of their
community, they would be simply set aside and other
provision would be made.</p>

<p>To achieve its purpose the Aurora Clan viewed the
situation with wide-open eyes. It saw things as they
were, and refused to consider them through any
medium that presented the picture in any different
light. It was gazing on the rawest human nature, for
all it was tricked out in the fashions of the twentieth
century. It was the same human nature that had
fought the old-time battle in the darkest ages, unchanged
in the smallest degree. So the Clan had
adopted the method which has always been the ultimate
control when humanity got out of hand. It was
the method of earliest man. And it will be the method
of the last. It was the appeal of Fear. In the opinion
of the controlling mind of the Aurora Clan there was
no short cut to any Utopia, or Millennium, or things of
that sort. There was even no such condition to arrive
at. Life was Self. Simply Self, even if, at times,
thinly disguised. And Self could only be sufficiently
impressed to keep it within the bounds of reasonable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
decency by the methods of control which had come
down throughout the ages. So the ugly banner of
Terror had been raised. Awe, Superstition, Terror.</p>

<p>To the humorous mind the grotesqueness of the
gathering must have been without question. Each pair
of eyes gazing through rudely cut eye-holes in those
conical hoods, if their humour were sufficient, must
inevitably have smiled at the sight of the other nineteen
ghostly figures squatting or standing about the
place with pipes and cigars protruding through mouth-holes
in the cloth of their hoods. In this respect these
men-ghosts were not sacrificing their comfort for any
undue regard for the impression they desired to
create. They were there for business. The cellar
was without comfort. They might be there for hours.
Well, tobacco was no outrage of their principles.</p>

<p>The place reeked with every grade of tobacco smoke.
Rank cigars and still ranker pipes had overridden the
musty dankness of the atmosphere. Decay in any
form was sufficiently abhorrent to the virile youth of
this gathering. So each did his best to mask it under
the fog of smoke which brought comfort to their
souls.</p>

<p>The sitting had been a long one. All sorts of reports
from individual councillors had been listened to,
voted upon, and upon which the Chief Light, leaning
against the central rusted furnace, had given his final
decision. There was no secretary to take down any
minutes of the meeting. No writing of any sort was
permitted. All the business of the Council was done
verbally. Sentence was passed on any delinquent reported
by the Chief Light, and the work of its execution
deputed by word of mouth. None but the Chief
Light knew upon whom such tasks devolved. Maybe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
there was recognition in the voices as each councillor
spoke, but that was all. Each member of the Council
was known by a numeral which was inscribed on the
white front of his gown, and, so long as he might
serve on the Council, that would be the only form of
identification permitted.</p>

<p>Towards the end of the session a stoutish councillor,
with “No. 3” blazoned on the bosom of his cloak,
bestirred himself. He made a sign which conveyed
his claim to attention. It was given without question.
The tall form of the Chief Light was instantly turned
in his direction.</p>

<p>“‘No. 3’ has a report for the Council,” he said, in
that curious hollow tone which his masking hood gave
to his voice. “We’ll take his report next.”</p>

<p>He paused for an instant while the eyes behind his
mask surveyed his supporters. Then he went on in
the quiet business-like fashion which marked his conduct
of affairs at all times.</p>

<p>“There is need for explanation,” he said. “‘Number
Three’ was delegated to certain work at a meeting
of the Supreme Executive which met in emergency
awhile back. Many of this Council were not present
at the time. You need to get it that his work was of
more than usual importance to the general community.
Maybe you’ll all likely remember there was a tough guy
called Cy Liskard who blew into the Speedway on the
night of Max’s celebration, and raised particular sort
of hell there. ‘Number Three’s’ report concerns this
man. This man Cy Liskard is reputed to have made
a big strike of gold way back on the Lias River.
And, anyway, he’s sold big dust at the bank and holds
a credit there. It’s reckoned he’s hugging this strike
to his bosom and we’ve made it our special business<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
to see, if it’s right, that the field outside his claim is
made available to the folks of our city.”</p>

<p>There was a slight but definite movement amongst
the Chief Light’s audience. Those who were sitting
turned in the direction of ‘Number Three.’ Those
who were standing gazed round on the sturdy figure
expectantly.</p>

<p>“We’ll take Number Three’s report.”</p>

<p>The Chief Light leant back against his furnace support
prepared to listen with the rest.</p>

<p>“Number Three” plunged at once into his story. He
began formally, but quickly drifted into the vernacular
common to them all.</p>

<p>“By the will of the Supreme Executive I set out to
investigate under the orders received. Six Clansmen
accompanied me. It was a darn big trip, an’ we were
chasing a wily guy an’ a pretty bright trailman. I
was lucky in having ‘Number Twenty-Six’ with me,
who’s wise to the country of the Lias River. Well,
I don’t guess to worry you folks with the details of
that trip. We made it all right, all right. We tracked
our man right up to his home in the hills. He was
there, an’ we doped him and his dogs quiet so we could
work easy. And a pretty fancy hiding hole he’s got.
It lies well nigh back on the Canadian Border.”</p>

<p>“Number Three” paused. And a shuffling of feet
and the clearing of throats indicated the deepening interest
of his audience.</p>

<p>“Say, it’s queer,” the sturdy figure went on reflectively.
“He’s got a claim there all right. He’s got a
swell sluice on a creek, and a big dump of stuff piled
around it. He’s got a shanty on the hillside, and corrals
for his ponies. He’s got a bunch of trail dogs
to carry him anywhere on a winter trail. Then he’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
got a swell canoe, and all the gear of the goldman.
But&mdash;” He broke off and, as he gazed round on his
audience, it was almost as if he were smiling behind
his mask. “&mdash;we couldn’t see he’d washed an ounce
of dust since ever he set up his sluice. I want to tell
you right here, folks, if there’s a thing I’m a’mighty
wise to in this darn country it’s washing the yellow
stuff I’ve been chasing twenty years. There’s no guy
on the Lias River can put me wise to any notion I
haven’t got. Well, I tell you right now that boy hasn’t
washed out any gold on that claim ever since it was
staked. He’s set it all out. It ’ud look good to a bum
tenderfoot. Maybe, even, some of you boys ’ud fall
for his show down. But he can’t bluff me a thing.
That claim, and all his fancy gear, is a mighty big
bluff. That’s all. He hain’t worked fi’ cents of gold&mdash;there.</p>

<p>“But he’s passed a big pouch of dust into the bank.
We’re wise to that. Where does he work that stuff?”
The man paused again. Then a sound came from behind
his mask. It was a funereal sort of laugh. “I
ain’t wise. But I went through with the job as it was
ordered. This guy has been seen chasing around the
coast at the mouth of his river. We came right down
the length of that river with our eyes wide open for
any blamed sign.” He shook his cowled head. “He’s
got no workings anywhere along that river. But we
found something. Oh, yes. We surely did. It’s a
tough coast, and hard to chase up right. There’s a
thousand holes an’ corners for a cache an’ that sort
of truck. Anyway we located a sort of creek that was
hidden all up. It was rocks and overgrowth so we
mostly had a hell of a time making our way in. But
we got through. And, cached right away up it, cached<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
so as only chance could locate it, we hit on a swell
motor boat fit to make a sea trip in tough weather.
Yes, we located that, and located something else. She
was in elegant shape, and we searched her clear
through even to her gasoline tanks. And in one of
her lockers we found two bags, canvas bags such as
I knew as soon as I set eyes on ’em. They were
empty. I turned ’em inside out. There was the remains
of dust in ’em caught up in the seams, an’ I
made a collection of it. Sir,” he went on, addressing
himself directly to the tall figure of the Chief Light,
“that’s my report, and I wait for instructions. Ther’s
a few bits o’ details I ain’t spoken on that I ken hand
you when you got time to go into them. Maybe they
signify some. I don’t rightly know. Meanwhile,
that’s the report I got to hand to this Council.”</p>

<p>The Chief Light nodded.</p>

<p>“Good,” he said. “I’ll take those details later.
Meanwhile, you don’t figger this Cy Liskard is on a
strike on his claim?”</p>

<p>Number Three shook his head promptly.</p>

<p>“I don’t say all that, Chief,” he said quickly. “The
thing I say is the claim he’s got staked around his
home place is sheer bluff. Maybe he’s blinding us.
Maybe his claim lies elsewhere. That being so it’ll
likely take months locating it.”</p>

<p>At a sign from the Chief Light, full discussion on
the report of Number Three broke out. It was dealt
with exhaustively. Then the meeting passed on to
such other business as claimed it.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Alan Goodchurch was typical of officialdom, but
possessing a leavening of real human interest in the
life of which he was in official control. In Beacon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
Glory his prestige stood reasonably high, but simply
because of that leavening. In his official capacity as
Commissioner of the district and chief collector of
revenues for the government he represented, there
was no particular goodwill displayed towards him.
But then Beacon Glory had no sort of use whatsoever
for an authority that had its origin so far away that
it required something in the nature of an astronomical
telescope to discover its existence. As a man it was
wholly different. He was a cheery creature outside
his office, alive with kindly sympathy for the difficulties
and troubles besetting his fellow-townsmen and
really eager for the steady progress and prosperity of
the heterogeneous collection of life it was his lot to
endeavour to shepherd in its duty towards its Government.</p>

<p>He was a youngish man for his post. But then it
was well enough recognised that in this especial locality
his was a youngish man’s work. Beacon Glory
needed a strong official hand and a strong official
mind, and Goodchurch possessed these things arrayed
in a tall muscular frame and a large, lean face with
pronouncedly square jaws.</p>

<p>Ivor McLagan was on reasonably intimate terms
with Goodchurch. It was his business to be so, for
whatever the general attitude of the men of Beacon
Glory towards their Commissioner, the oil man’s business
demanded official goodwill.</p>

<p>It was a moment in Goodchurch’s official life when
the human element in him was uppermost. He sat
turned away from his desk, lounging in his swivel
chair, talking to the engineer and smoking a cigar, the
latter a most unusual proceeding in his working hours.
McLagan was overflowing a smaller bare wood chair<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
opposite him, and he, too, was smoking one of the
Commissioner’s best cigars.</p>

<p>The strong face of Goodchurch was smiling pleasantly,
and his keen grey eyes had lost their usual cold
stare which had taken him years to cultivate. He
shook his head.</p>

<p>“There’s no such darn vessel registered at Boston,”
he said. “And there’s no owner yearning to claim
anything with a name like the <i>Limpet</i>. That doesn’t
leave me guessing. There’s such a thing as insurance.
In a while, maybe, we’ll be getting word from some
underwriting house. Then the fur’ll fly, and some
one’ll be squealing in the Courts. Anyway, the position’s
clear. Boston’s never heard of the <i>Limpet</i>
and isn’t yearning to.”</p>

<p>McLagan removed his cigar and flicked the ash into
an immaculate cuspidor. His narrow eyes surveyed
the neat apartment which gave some indication of the
man who presided there. It was Goodchurch’s private
room in the best commercial block in Beacon
which was more than half given up to his staff. He
knew well enough the range of this man’s work. It
was from the highest to the lowest in the realms of
the city’s discipline. And for all the man’s capacity,
McLagan felt like smiling at the thought of the net
result of his labours.</p>

<p>However, his concern at the moment lay in other
directions. This was his last visit to Beacon before
setting out on a prolonged exploration into the hills,
and he desired the Commissioner’s valuable aid in a
direction in which he knew he could rely on it.</p>

<p>He nodded.</p>

<p>“That’s pretty clear,” he said. “What next?”</p>

<p>Goodchurch shook his head.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span></p>

<p>“There don’t seem to be much to be done&mdash;next,”
he said thoughtfully. “After all, what is it? A windjammer
blows in on to the rocks of this abominable
coast. You reckon she’s mostly a cargo of lumber
aboard. Well, lumber’s no sort of use on this coast.”
He smiled. “Gold’s the only thing, or oil, that’s going
to set our folks whooping. There don’t seem to be
a soul yearning to claim that craft. Even the folks
who quit her.” He shook his head again. “No.
There’s not a thing worth doing but what I’ve done.
My report’s gone in. That’s usual. I guess I can
send a couple of boys down to view things, but if we
know anything of the seas beating on this coast line,
the storms that drove her on the rocks are liable to
hammer her to matchwood in a month or so. And
then there’ll be nothing&mdash;more.”</p>

<p>McLagan agreed.</p>

<p>“It seems that way,” he said, with an assumption
of indifference. “Yet I’ve a sublimely foolish notion
there’s something queer behind that wreck. And the
notion’s got hold of me good.”</p>

<p>“Queer, eh?” Goodchurch’s eyes narrowed, and he
surveyed the cigar in his fingers reflectively. Then
he chuckled quietly. “Yes,” he went on. “Insurance.
And that’s not in my work&mdash;once my report is sent
in to my chiefs.”</p>

<p>McLagan bestirred himself. He realised the official
horizon of this otherwise excellent man. He stood
up.</p>

<p>“I told you I’d got a notion,” he said simply. “Well,
I got more. And I’m wondering if you’ll help me
out on it. I’ve an idea, more than an idea&mdash;a conviction,
in fact, that the name of that bunch of wreckage
has been changed. It was changed on purpose.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
Real, desperate purpose. If we can locate the owners
and anyone else interested in the <i>Imperial</i> of Bristol,
we shall get back of a darn ugly story that’s liable
to get your department jumping on a red-hot trail.
That’s why I came along now. It’s to give you that
before I go right up into the country on a survey
that’s going to keep me busy till the summer’s nearly
through. I daresay by the time I get back the storming
will have left nothing of that wreck on the rocks.
It don’t matter. Her story don’t lie in her now. It
lies in the owners and crew who are the folks that
need finding. You broadcasted before for the other
name. Will you do it for this? Will you send it to
the newspapers? And pass it right on to any old
region that can pick it up? I’d be glad, an’&mdash;grateful.”</p>

<p>Goodchurch laughed. He realised the oil man’s
earnestness, but it left him quite unaffected.</p>

<p>“Sure, I will, Mac,” he said cordially. “How did
you locate the change of name? What’s the story you
reckon to discover?”</p>

<p>The other shrugged his heavy shoulders as he flung
his cigar stump into the cuspidor.</p>

<p>“It’s clear enough&mdash;with the suspicion of it in your
mind. I got a close look at the painted names on the
boats, and life belts, and anything that had the ship’s
name on it. Mostly the change has been made good.
But, like all things of that nature, it was a long job
and the folks doing it maybe got weary of it. In
two cases, at least, I recognised the old name had been
painted or scraped out&mdash;some of the letters, and others
substituted. I’m sure, dead sure.”</p>

<p>“And the story?”</p>

<p>McLagan shook his head and smiled.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span></p>

<p>“Murder, I’d guess&mdash;amongst other things,” he said
simply.</p>

<p>“Murder?”</p>

<p>Goodchurch sat up.</p>

<p>“Sure. And I’m looking to find who did it and
why.”</p>

<p>Goodchurch whistled.</p>

<p>“That sort of show gets a man.”</p>

<p>“Ye-es.”</p>

<p>“Anything else?”</p>

<p>“If I told you haf the things in my head you’d
guess I was bug.”</p>

<p>Goodchurch laughed.</p>

<p>“I’d need more than that to reckon Ivor McLagan
that way.” He stood up. “Well, I’ll surely do as you
ask, right away. And I guess I’ll take a trip out to
view that wreck myself&mdash;instead of sending any of
the boys.”</p>

<p>McLagan held out a hand which the official gripped
with cordiality.</p>

<p>“Why, do,” he said. “And make use of my shanty
all you please. My boy’ll be along there if I’m away,
and he’ll fix you right. I’ll leave word. An’, say,”
he added with a shrewd smile as he moved towards
the door, “if you’re not looking for a scare, don’t get
aboard of that craft when the sun’s shining.”</p>

<p>“What? Say&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>But McLagan shook his head. “I’m not going to
hand you a thing else,” he said laughingly. “I’m not
yearning for you to get beyond the limits of your
belief in my sanity. Maybe I won’t see you again till
I get through with my trip. So long.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>McLagan hurried down the sidewalk in the direction
of the Speedway. He was thinking with a concentration
that left him oblivious to his surroundings
and with only his objective clear in his mind. Once
he smiled to himself as the thought of Alan Goodchurch’s
remark about his sanity flashed intrusively
upon his preoccupation. He felt sure that it was as
well for his purpose that he had added nothing of the
thing absorbing him now to that which he had imparted
to the Commissioner. No. The thing he had
in his mind must remain there untold until he had
completed the chain of circumstances he saw linking
themselves together. Either he was stark, staring,
raving mad, or&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>He bumped into Victor Burns just outside the
banker’s office, and the collision brought him back to
his surroundings and the realisation of his friend’s
laughing protest.</p>

<p>“Say, you great unmitigated boob, with your two
yards of meat, ain’t there room for an ounce or two
like me on the same earth?”</p>

<p>McLagan laughed.</p>

<p>“Ounce or two? Say&mdash;when two folks collide on
the sidewalk it mostly seems to me occasion for discussion.
Who is it has right of way? The feller
using the sidewalk for its original purpose, or the
feller standing around with a figger calculated to set
an oil man yearning? I’ve got five minutes for a yarn
in your office.”</p>

<p>Burns smiled up into the twinkling eyes.</p>

<p>“Come right in,” he said. “I’ve mostly got five
minutes any time of day for the man who reckons to
flood Beacon out with oil.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span></p>

<p>They passed into the bank and to the private office.
McLagan perched his great bulk on the desk and
grinned down on his still standing friend.</p>

<p>“Just sit around, Victor,” he said, while the other
waited for the purpose lying behind this sudden and
unexpected visit. “I want you to talk, to yarn in your
own sweet way about the darn stuff you’re here to
deal in. I want you to tell me all you know about
the stuff. Its grades. Its colours. And the localities
where the colours are found, or have been found. I
want you to lay bare your golden soul to me the same
as from time to time I’ve told you the juicy details
of the stuff I spend my life chasing. Can you do it
in ten minutes?”</p>

<p>“Not in ten weeks.”</p>

<p>“That’s tough. I’ve got just a haf hour.”</p>

<p>“It was ten minutes last and five before,” laughed
the intrigued banker.</p>

<p>“Well, let’s get down to bed rock. I can set you
haf-a-dozen questions, and we’ll fix it that way.”</p>

<p>“Have you made a ‘strike’?”</p>

<p>McLagan laughed.</p>

<p>“No, siree! But <em>I’m</em> going to set the questions to
this examination.”</p>

<p>“I may sit.”</p>

<p>The banker’s eyes were shining with the humour
of the thing. But he was wondering, too. He had
never known McLagan to have more than a passing
interest in the trade he dealt in. And somehow, he
now seemed to be in deadly earnest for all his lightness.</p>

<p>“Sure you may,” the oil man said. “And smoke,
too, if you feel that way. It’s good to smoke if you
need to think.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span></p>

<p>Victor took his place at the desk on which McLagan
was sitting and pushed a box of cigars at his guest.
He sat back in his chair while the other lit up and
regarded him thoughtfully.</p>

<p>“Well?” he demanded, with his hands clasped across
his rotund body. “Get busy with those questions.”</p>

<p>“There’s more than one colour to gold?”</p>

<p>“Yes. Quite a number of shades in raw gold.”</p>

<p>“Governed by the locality in which it’s found?”</p>

<p>“Surely. The formations. Reef gold. Alluvial.
The copperous qualities of quartz. The climated conditions
of the various latitudes in which it is found.
A whole heap of influences affect the shades of
colour.”</p>

<p>McLagan nodded.</p>

<p>“Now Alaskan gold?”</p>

<p>“It varies the same as the rest.”</p>

<p>“Could you tell Alaskan gold from tropical gold?”</p>

<p>“It depends on circumstances. Generally, yes. I’ve
got samples here,” the banker went on quickly, pulling
out a drawer beside him.</p>

<p>He lifted out a leather case and flung it open. It
held a number of small glass bottles each containing
a sample of yellow dust. Each bottle was carefully
labelled.</p>

<p>“We keep these as a matter of interest. They’re
small samples of each different strike made in the
neighbourhood with which we trade. You see? Examine
them. Compare them. There’s many differ
shades.”</p>

<p>He sat back again while the oil man picked up each
bottle in turn and compared them one with the other,
and the banker found it profoundly interesting to
note the intensity of scrutiny to which the man whose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
interests had nothing to do with gold examined them.</p>

<p>“Do you realise the varying shades?”</p>

<p>McLagan was holding one bottle, searching its contents
closely.</p>

<p>“This is pale sort of stuff,” he said.</p>

<p>The banker looked at the label.</p>

<p>“Reef gold from the Ubishi Hills. It was a poor
strike and petered out. Crystal quartz. And too hard
to work for the ordinary gold man. It needed big
capital.”</p>

<p>McLagan nodded.</p>

<p>“Hardly yellow at all,” he said. “Now this,” he
went on, holding up another bottle. “This has a richer
colour.”</p>

<p>“Sure. But look where it’s from. The red copperous
gravel of Eighty Mile Creek. I’d say, next to
some of the big Australian finds, that’s one of the
handsomest colours known. Here’s another,” he went
on, thrusting another bottle into his visitor’s hand.
“It’s nigh as red. It’s like as two peas with the
African stuff, and some of the old Californian colour.
It might even be from West Australia. But it isn’t.
No, it’s Alaskan. And it’s creek gold.”</p>

<p>“Where from?”</p>

<p>“I can’t rightly say&mdash;yet. Maybe we’ll learn in
good time. We generally do. You see, it’s a sample
of the stuff brought in by a boy who’s working along
the Lias River territory. That boy I told you of
awhile back. The feller you beat over the head at the
Speedway the night of its festival. Pretty stuff.”</p>

<p>McLagan was turning the bottle in his hand. He
rolled its contents over and over, intently examining
its colour and the texture of its grains.</p>

<p>“It’s cleaner than most,” he said presently. “Looks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>
like it was washed by a pretty expert hand. It’s like
none of the others. Not even the Eighty Mile stuff.
Eighty Mile&mdash;that’s on the Canadian side.”</p>

<p>“Yes.” Burns eased himself in his chair. “No.
It’s not like any of the other. It looks like tropical
stuff, and if I didn’t know better, I’d surely say it
was.”</p>

<p>McLagan set the bottle down and sat gazing at it.</p>

<p>“What is there there? An ounce?” he asked, without
raising his eyes.</p>

<p>“Half, I’d guess.”</p>

<p>“Can you sell me it?”</p>

<p>Burns chuckled.</p>

<p>“Why, I could, but&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Will you?”</p>

<p>McLagan was gazing squarely into the smiling
round face before him. The banker’s shrewd mind
was thinking quickly. He shook his head.</p>

<p>“No,” he said. “You can have that bottle, a present
at my expense. I’m glad when a man like you gets
interested in our stuff. Some day, maybe, you’ll quit
oil for the other. But, say, won’t you tell me about
it? You’ve got me guessing.”</p>

<p>“There just isn’t a thing to tell, Victor.”</p>

<p>“Sure?”</p>

<p>The banker’s eyes were looking squarely into the
other’s.</p>

<p>“Not&mdash;now.”</p>

<p>“I see.”</p>

<p>McLagan had removed himself from the desk. He
still held the bottle with its sample of gold-dust in
his hand.</p>

<p>Victor stood up and nodded comprehensively.</p>

<p>“That’s all right, boy,” he said. “If it’s any use,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
keep that stuff. I’m shipping a mighty big dope of it
away by next mail. You’d be astonished if you knew
how much. Say, how’s that wreck down your way
making out? The folks are all guessing about it. A
lumber ship, ain’t it? Any news of the owners yet?”</p>

<p>“Not yet,” McLagan replied. “Guess the seas’ll
break her to pieces in a while. Say, Victor, I’m
mighty obliged for our talk&mdash;and this.” He held up
the bottle and then set it in an inner pocket. Then
he thrust out a hand in farewell. “Guess I won’t see
you for quite awhile. When I do I’ll have big news
concerning oil for you. Are you looking to get in?”</p>

<p>“Always.” The banker gripped the outstretched
hand.</p>

<p>“Right. I’ll do the best I know for you when the
time comes. Thanks.”</p>

<p>McLagan passed out on to the sidewalk again. Just
for a moment he stood deeply considering, then he
turned away and moved off in the direction where the
best dwelling-houses stood something apart from the
collection of hovels which made up by far the greater
proportion of the city’s home residences.</p>

<span class="fs95">McLagan Achieves an End</span></h2>


<p class="drop-capy1">CLAIRE CARVER was alone in the sun-parlour,
which was one of the many small comforts she
had added to the square, frame building which, since
the bettering of her fortunes, had become her home.
She was occupying a large rocker-chair, engaged upon
a task hardly to be expected in a woman whose nights
were spent at the gaming tables of the Speedway, and
whose skill, and nerve, and capacity in holding her own
against the vulture-like flotsam haunting that gambling
hell, was a by-word of the countryside.</p>

<p>Her busy needle was plying swiftly and skilfully
upon some intimate silken garment, the contemplation
of which gave her the deepest sense of womanly satisfaction.
A small table was near to her hand littered
with all the odds and ends which usually overflow a
woman’s work-basket. She was quite alone with her
work and her thoughts. She was even glad that her
mother was somewhere in the domestic quarters of the
house engaged, as was her wont at all times, upon
matters relating to creature comfort. She knew that
the older woman had found solace in their new life
and she was glad. She had found something like happiness
in the care of her one remaining offspring who
had become all in all to her since those days of her
earlier disaster.</p>

<p>The afternoon was well advanced. The sun was
pouring out of the western sky, moving on with that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
speed which ever seems to increase as the day progresses.
It was hot but pleasant. The day was quite
windless, and the hum of mosquitoes and flies was incessant
beyond the netting covering to the range of
open windows with which the place was almost completely
surrounded.</p>

<p>After a while the girl looked up and her pretty
blue eyes were unsmiling. The satisfaction she had
in her work found no reflection in them. There was
even a suggestion of unhappiness in the preoccupation
of the gaze she turned upon the scene beyond the
netted windows.</p>

<p>Perhaps she was tired. Perhaps there was weariness
of mind behind her eyes. Her beauty was no
less. There were no outward and visible signs of
wear for all the high pressure of the artificial sort
of life she lived. But the buoyancy, the intensity her
wonderful eyes usually displayed under the shaded
lights of the Speedway’s poker room were utterly lacking
now. It almost suggested that the fierce fires of
the gambler spirit had already begun to burn the youth
out of her.</p>

<p>The scene beyond the netted windows seemed to
hold her. The city lay there sprawling on the lake
shore. A scattering of small dwellings intervened between
her and the main buildings. It was squalid. It
was as ugly as only a collection of primitive human
dwellings could make it. From where she sat she
could see the pretentious dome of Max’s Speedway,
which was the medium of her fortune. She could see
a flash of the sunlit waters of the lake, and then beyond,
overshadowing all the puny human handiwork,
rose the dark outline of the splendid hills of her childhood.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span></p>

<p>It was the latter that held her, and in a moment the
precious silken garment upon which she had spent
more dollars than a year ago she could have spent
cents, was completely forgotten.</p>

<p>Her thought had flung back to another life and its
people; folk, who, unlike herself, lived in the open and
the daylight. She was thinking of the rugged coast
with its fiercely alluring bays, its inlets and its upstanding
headlands. She was thinking of the rough,
strong man who lived in a home like an eagle’s eyrie
so that he could gaze upon God’s good world and
revel in those fierce, bracing elements which so appealed
to and matched his own nature. She remembered
that last recent meeting with him on the deck
of the wreck in the bay from which she had fled in
utter and complete panic.</p>

<p>It was a moment not easily to be forgotten. She
still shrank from contemplating her own display of
weakness, but it robbed her of not one moment’s delight
in the memory of the quiet nerve and calm resolution
with which Ivor McLagan had reassured and
comforted her. Then she remembered the time when
he had deliberately picked her up in his arms and
helped her over the vessel’s side. He had done it without
a second thought, and as though he had been dealing
with some terrified child. And then she remembered
his plain face as it had smiled back into hers
over the side of the vessel as returning courage had
once more restored her confidence.</p>

<p>He was quite plain and generally unsmiling for all
a certain humour she sometimes saw lying behind his
eyes. Then he was so harshly rough&mdash;at times. It
was not always so. And it was mostly manner. Oh,
she knew that, and she smiled softly to herself as she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>
thought of the fashion in which he had sought to
drive her from the deck of that vessel. She sighed.
She liked him. She liked and trusted him. Nobody
could help liking him, she told herself. He was so
transparently honest and&mdash;and simple. Then she
smiled again, almost tenderly, as she reviewed those
scenes in which he and she had been the only actors.
How many were they? How many times had he
asked her to&mdash;&mdash;?</p>

<p>Her eyes sobered and her thought passed swiftly
to another man. It was the dark Italian face of Max
Lepende that shut out her vision of the other. The
thing she feared, the thing she had even discussed
with Ivor, was impending. Her woman’s instinct was
deeply perturbed as she thought of a little scene that
had occurred just as she was leaving the Speedway
the night before. Max had approached her as her
game broke up. She had had an especial run of good
luck. He came to her smiling, elaborate, and impressive
in his manner. He had asked her permission to
ride with her in her automobile to her home. There
was a bunch of “toughs” around, he told her. He
had had word of a possible hold-up. She must bank
with him for the night and he begged her to accept
his escort. Then had come the demonstration of the
man’s purpose. In the automobile he had produced a
jewelled pendant of great value. He had craved her
acceptance of it with all the display which his extravagant
manner made so sickening to her. He had almost
forced it upon her. But she had refused, definitely,
even coldly, and she had witnessed the instant
effect of her refusal upon him.</p>

<p>The girl was more of a psychologist than perhaps
she knew. She had certainly learned to know something<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>
of the man who ruled over the destinies of the
Speedway. She had watched Max as he returned the
pendant to its case. Driving the automobile, with her
eyes on the disreputable road, she had still been aware
of the sudden cold, hard light that had replaced the
smile in the man’s dark eyes, and noted the almost
vicious snap with which he closed the case over the
glittering jewels he had offered her. And in that moment
she had remembered her talk with Ivor on the
subject of this man, and was glad of it. It was good
to think of Ivor McLagan, with his plain strong face,
at such a moment. And the more so when the car
had stopped at her home, and Max had alighted and
was taking his leave of her. What were his parting
words? Oh, she remembered them. They were not
easily forgotten, and as much for their tone as their
text. He had spoken with the same old smile she
knew by heart, and which she knew to be as meaningless
as all the rest of his artificialities.</p>

<p>“I guess the hold-up didn’t mature,” he had said.
“I sort of felt it wouldn’t, Claire, with me around.
You see, the folks of this city mostly have more sense
than to get across me. The toughest of them wouldn’t
take a chance that way. And they’re surely wise. I’m
feeling sore, my dear, you couldn’t feel like handling
that toy I was hoping to pass you. Think it over.
Don’t leave it the way it is. Get a sleep on it and
maybe, like that hold-up, you’ll think better of it.”</p>

<p>It was a threat and the girl knew it. It was that
moment which she had long since contemplated when
she must choose between this smooth, unscrupulous
creature who had built his fortune upon the human
weakness of those about him, and abandoning the
precincts of the place which had represented salvation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>
to her in her darkest moments. Ivor was right.
“You’re going to get it if you keep on&mdash;&mdash;” She remembered
his words. They were right. She had
known it at the time he had uttered them. And, somehow
she was glad and it comforted her, that it was
he who had uttered them, and begged her to quit the
game at the Speedway. Well&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>She turned her head sharply. She heard voices
talking beyond the parlour doorway. They were her
mother’s and another which she recognised instantly.
It was the voice of the man of whom she was thinking.
In a moment she had bundled the silken garment
in her lap out of sight.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>There was no sign to indicate Claire’s mood of the
moment before. She was smiling up into McLagan’s
face, and the man was telling her without subterfuge
the object of his visit.</p>

<p>“You see, Claire,” he said, “I had to come along
for two reasons. One is, I’m going right up into the
hills for a month or so and won’t be along back in
Beacon till summer’s nigh through and so I won’t see
you in quite awhile. And the other is&mdash;&mdash;” He
laughed in his short, unmirthful fashion, “why&mdash;something
else.”</p>

<p>The mother had left him to make his way to the
sun-parlour while she returned to her interrupted
labours. She was glad enough to do so. There was
never a moment in her simple life that she was completely
without hope of this man as a son-in-law.</p>

<p>McLagan had sprawled his great body into a protesting
cane-rocker. The table, with its feminine litter
intervened between him and the woman who was the
most precious thing in all the world to him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span></p>

<p>“Seeing there’s two reasons, I guess that’s so,”
Claire said slily. Then her smile lit anew. “But I’m
real glad you came along now, Ivor. I’d just have
hated you going along up to the hills and being away
all that time without seeing me first.” Then she
laughed outright. “Say, what’ll your tame spook be
doing with you away?”</p>

<p>The man shook his head.</p>

<p>“I don’t rightly know,” he said seriously. “Maybe
the sea’ll swallow him up. And I’d say it would be
good that way.” Then a deep light grew in his eyes.
“But it’s real kind of you saying that, Claire. I just
had to come along, anyway.”</p>

<p>The girl wanted to ask him why. There was an
impulse, a quick, hot impulse to challenge him, and
somehow it was an impulse which only a brief while
ago would never have been stirring. But she refrained.
Instead she turned her eyes to the wide-open
windows, and gazed away at the hills of her childhood.</p>

<p>“You see, I’ve got things to tell you&mdash;before I go.
And they’re important,” McLagan went on quietly.</p>

<p>The girl’s gaze remained upon the hills so full of
memory for her. But suddenly her pulses had started
to hammer in a fashion so unruly that she was horrified
lest the man might be aware of it.</p>

<p>“You mean about that&mdash;wreck?”</p>

<p>“Yes. About that&mdash;wreck.”</p>

<p>Claire sighed. Her pulses had suddenly sobered.
But the calm that replaced her moment of emotion
had no satisfaction in it. Now her gaze came back
to the man’s face. And the wide blue eyes were striving
for a smile of interest she did not feel.</p>

<p>“Yes, tell me,” she said, with a pretence of eagerness.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>
“It was all very mystifying and horrible. I
haven’t forgotten. I’d say it isn’t easy to forget that
sort of thing. My, I was scared.”</p>

<p>McLagan began to grope in his pockets.</p>

<p>“May I smoke?” He was holding up his cigar-case.</p>

<p>“Surely,” the girl laughed. “Isn’t it queer? You
haven’t always asked that.”</p>

<p>“No,” the man smiled back. He glanced about the
handsome loggia with its pretty comforts. “It’s queer
the way we change with circumstances.”</p>

<p>“Yes. Smoke up. I like the rougher things best.
Maybe I didn’t always feel that way. I’ve seen so
much of the smooth and shining since I came to Max’s
Speedway that I kind of like to think of the rough
granite I used to know back there in the hills.”</p>

<p>McLagan glanced out of the window as he lit his
long, lean cigar.</p>

<p>“Yes,” he said. “It’s stood up to things since the
world began. Say, kid, I want you to hand me anything
you can about&mdash;Jim. I mean, I know the story
you and your Mum handed me at the time. I know
all that, but&mdash;&mdash; Say, he’d made a real big strike in
Australia and was on his way back to home. Was he
bringing his stuff along? Or was it banked? What
were the plans he’d made? I sort of remember a long
letter he’d sent. Did he hand your Mum details?”</p>

<p>Claire was startled. She sat up in her rocker and
one beautifully shaped hand was raised and passed
across her smooth brow. Then it rested for a moment
upon her wealth of ruddy hair.</p>

<p>“We&mdash;we don’t know a thing, Ivor,” she said in
a low voice, as she gazed earnestly into his face. “Not
a thing but what you’ve heard from us. He’d made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>
a strike. I&mdash;I believe it was a wonderful strike. His
letter conveyed that. And he was on his way home
on the <i>Imperial</i> with the result of it. But whether
in dust or a bank credit I can’t even guess. Then the
ship sank, and he was drowned&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>McLagan shook his head.</p>

<p>“Not drowned,” he said.</p>

<p>For some moments there followed complete silence.</p>

<p>“But the ship sank. They picked up the S O S.
She’s never been heard of since. It was in mid-ocean.
And Jim&mdash;Jim has never been heard of again.”</p>

<p>The girl’s protest came with swift passionate intensity.</p>

<p>“The ship didn’t sink. And Jim wasn’t&mdash;drowned.”</p>

<p>McLagan spoke in that queer rough fashion he
never failed to use in moments of deep conviction.</p>

<p>Claire stared at him with questioning eyes. A
surge of emotion was driving through her. There
was such conviction in the man’s tone and manner.
Jim was not drowned. The <i>Imperial</i> did not sink.
Suddenly she leant forward.</p>

<p>“What do you mean, Ivor?” she urged in a tone
almost as rough as his. “Tell me. Tell me quick.
I must know. Jim’s alive. The <i>Imperial</i>&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>McLagan shook his head.</p>

<p>“I don’t think he’s alive. And the ship&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“You mean he’s dead&mdash;killed&mdash;maybe&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Murdered for his stuff.”</p>

<p>Again there fell a silence and the man watched the
face of the girl through the smoke of his cigar. Her
breath was coming quickly, and she was struggling
for composure. At last she steadied herself.</p>

<p>“Ivor, tell me. Oh, tell me all you know. Don’t
keep me in suspense. I know. I see. It’s&mdash;it’s something<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>
to do with that wreck and&mdash;and the shadow&mdash;&mdash;”
She flung out one delicate finger, pointing, “That figure.
It&mdash;it&mdash;was&mdash;Jim’s&mdash;shadow. Oh!”</p>

<p>The girl’s intuition had leapt. There was excitement,
passion, horror in that final ejaculation and the
man saw that it was no moment for delay. There
was a dreadful look in the beautiful eyes that were
gazing wildly into his. He removed his cigar.</p>

<p>“Get a grip on yourself, little girl,” he said quickly,
and in that tone of gentleness he only rarely used.
“I’ll tell you what I know. It’s not a deal. But it’s
enough to say&mdash;to my mind&mdash;that Jim was murdered.
The wreck down on my coast is your Jim’s ship. That
I know beyond doubt. And that shadow&mdash;I don’t know
how it comes there, I don’t know the meaning of
ghostly shadows, but I guess I’ve convinced myself I’ve
recognised in that shadow a crazy sort of outline of
your Jim. Jim was a mighty big man and he had a
walk I’d recognise dead easy. Do you remember, kid,
that ghost, or whatever it was, was moving. It was
a queer figure of a man walking&mdash;towards us. Do you
remember? But of course you do. Do you know I
sort of recognised Jim’s walk in that thing’s movements?”
He shook his head with a puzzled, far-off
look in his eyes. “Guess, maybe, it’s fancy. Maybe
I’m all wrong. But, anyway, the notion’s back of my
head. Jim died right there on that deck. He was
killed&mdash;murdered&mdash;<em>while he was walking aft</em>.”</p>

<p>He went on at once as the girl remained silent.</p>

<p>“Who killed him? And why?” He shrugged his
great shoulders. “That’s the thing I’m going to find
out. Where’s the skipper and crew of that ship?
They quit her in fair weather. Why? Who changed
her name? Why? Why kill your brother? For his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>
wad? Sure. Not for any bank credit. Where’s his
partner, that boy, Len Stern? He’s not showed up.”</p>

<p>Claire was listening to his every word with close
attention. Such was her intensity that her lips moved
as though she were repeating to herself the things he
said. The instant he ceased speaking, sharp and passionately
came her challenge.</p>

<p>“You’ve more than that to tell, Ivor!” she cried.
“Tell it me. You must. Oh, you don’t know all this
means to me. You don’t know the ugly thing you’ve
raised up in me. Ivor&mdash;Ivor&mdash;! I think I could kill
the man who murdered our Jim with my own two
hands. He was my brother. He hadn’t a thought but
for us. There’s not a thing in all the world I wouldn’t
do to&mdash;to hand those folks who murdered him the
justice they need. It just frightens me the way I
feel. Tell me.”</p>

<p>“There isn’t a thing more to tell now, Claire. There
surely isn’t. I don’t know a thing yet but what I’ve
told you. But I mean to know.”</p>

<p>“And then you’ll come to me&mdash;and tell me?”</p>

<p>McLagan shook his head.</p>

<p>“Ther’ll be no need.” The man sat forward in his
chair, and reaching out one hand it closed over
the slim hand of the girl, which, in her urgent emotion,
had been laid upon her work-table. His whole
manner had softened from his threat against those he
was seeking. And, listening to him, the girl grew
calm under the influence of his gentle tone of supreme
confidence. “Say, Claire, I’ve asked for the right to
fix things for you. I’ve asked, and you’ve always refused.
Well, I’m asking nothing now. I’m just telling
you. Jim was your brother. Well, I’m just taking
to myself the right to get after the folks who’ve killed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>
him. You can’t stop me. No one can. And when
I’ve located ’em, when I’ve got ’em where I need ’em,
they’ll be dealt with, sure as God, in the fashion they
deserve. It’s my right which you can’t deny me. Jim
was a friend of mine and I love his sister better than
life. No,” he went on, in the same gentle tone, as the
girl released her hand from his. “I’m making no
break. I’m not asking a thing. I’m just telling you the
straight fact, and assuring you of the thing my mind’s
fixed on. Maybe I’ve made you angry. I can’t help
it. I don’t want to. There’s not a thing farther from
my mind. I want you to get the fact I’m claiming a
right the world, and you, can’t deny me. Now I want
you to try and forget all about it.”</p>

<p>“How can I forget it all?”</p>

<p>The girl shook her head. The trouble in her eyes
was almost painful. But through it all there was something
gazing out upon this big plain creature which
anybody but he must have interpreted without a second
thought.</p>

<p>“To you Jim has been dead nearly a year,” McLagan
said. “It’s just as it was. Only the circumstances are
different&mdash;now.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t mean that.”</p>

<p>“What did you mean?”</p>

<p>The man was startled. In an instant a flush dyed
his weather-stained cheek. Then it paled abruptly.
He turned and flung his cigar at an open window. It
hit the netting and fell on the floor. He sprang up
and collected it again and turned to the girl sitting with
her face turned away so that he only beheld the charm
of its profile.</p>

<p>“Claire?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Ivor?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span></p>

<p>“Would it worry you if I made another bad break?”</p>

<p>The girl shook her head.</p>

<p>“I don’t think so, Ivor.”</p>

<p>The man smoothed back his unruly hair.</p>

<p>“Here, I want to get it clear. There’s just one sort
of break I feel like making.”</p>

<p>His tone was rough and contained nothing of his
real feelings.</p>

<p>The girl inclined her head and her eyes came frankly
to his face. She read the doubt there. She read a
whole lot more.</p>

<p>“I only seem to remember one sort of break,” she
said, with the dawn of a smile that was irresistible.</p>

<p>“Thank God!”</p>

<p>In a moment all doubt had passed out of the man’s
eyes. He was smiling with all the transparent happiness
of a schoolboy. He came over to the girl’s chair,
and, reaching down, took possession of both her yielding
hands. She stood up, tall and slight, and infinitely
beautiful in her pretty afternoon frock.</p>

<p>“Now the right is doubly mine, little girl,” he said.
“And, by God! there’s no one on this darn old earth
going to rob me of it. Mine, eh? Mine at last!” And
caught her up in his arms.</p>

<span class="fs95">McLagan Returns from the Hills</span></h2>


<p class="drop-capy1">McLAGAN surveyed the litter strewn about the
beach. It was a queer collection. There were
two upturned boats with their white seams smeared
and daubed heavily with tar. They were hardly recognisable
as the well-painted lifeboats that had once stood
on the boat deck of the wreck lying on the far shore
of the bay. A wealth of ship’s ropes sprawled upon
the shingle. Ropes collected as a result of sheer covetousness
rather than from a point of view of utility.
Many of them were great hawsers and of no use whatsoever
in the sort of sailing that Sasa Minnik undertook.
Then there were heavy cable chains, and ship’s
buckets. There was a great store of tumbled ship’s
canvas. There were pots and pans and tools of every
description. There were an array of lumber, too, and
blankets, and plates, and knives and forks and dishes.
It was an amazing collection of sheer loot which only
the undisciplined mind of the half-breed could have
prompted. And it had been amassed in the two months
and more that McLagan had been away on his trip
up into the hills.</p>

<p>For some moments the white man regarded the collection
with frowning eyes. Then his gaze came back
to the sturdy figure of his servant whose dark features
were screwed up into that which the other interpreted
as a grin of sublime predatory satisfaction. His own<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>
eyes were deadly serious for all the smile lurking behind
them.</p>

<p>“Sasa,” he said quietly, “you always were a rogue
and a thief and a liar, but I never guessed you were
a bigger rogue than coward. The temptation of all
this loot was too much even for your scare, eh?
You’ve been aboard that wreck, and you’ve looted it
from end to end. I guess I ought to beat you. I surely
ought. But I’m not going to. No. It kind of seems
to me your low-down thieving nature’s knocked something
that’s even worse out of you&mdash;your rotten scare
of that ship. And that’s surely to the good. For me
you can keep your junk. But I don’t know what’ll
happen when the big Commissioner knows the thief
you are. Maybe he’ll have you hanged by your neck.
You helped save my life when that guy wanted it bad.
But I don’t see how I’m going to butt in when the big
Commissioner gets busy on you.”</p>

<p>The half-breed was undisturbed by the threat.
The creases on his ugly face only deepened and he
shook his head.</p>

<p>“The big man, Commissioner, not say nothing, boss,”
he said. “He come by ship. I tak him by ’em. Oh,
yes. An’ I say him: ‘Dis junk. It not nothing bimeby.
The sea all have ’em. Why not Sasa have ’em?’ An’
him big man say: ‘Sasa have him all much plenty what
he darn please.’ So I tak ’em all dis thing much.
An’ bimeby plenty much more. Maybe bimeby I mak
’em good trade. Oh, yes.”</p>

<p>“I see. Boss Goodchurch has been around?”</p>

<p>“Sure, boss. He come with him mans two. Him
look an’ look. Him see all thing plenty, but not the
devil spirit. Oh, no.” The man’s eyes widened at
the mere memory of the terrible shadow he still feared<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>
so dreadfully. “Him no sun when big man come.
Him not see. No. Then Sasa think big much. Sasa
say: ‘No sun, no devil spirit.’ It good. Sasa go by
ship when no sun. He wait. The sun him go down in
sea. It good. Bimeby Sasa get all thing that way.
Yes.”</p>

<p>McLagan laughed, and the half-breed grinned back
at him.</p>

<p>“You’re all sorts of a scoundrel, anyway, Sasa.”</p>

<p>“Sasa much wise man.”</p>

<p>The man’s final retort was quite unanswerable, and
the white man left it at that.</p>

<p>He glanced out over the grey, cold-looking waters.
The whole bay was more than usually desolate and
bleak now that the height of summer had spent itself.
The fall lay ahead. It was already in the atmosphere.
That swiftly passing fall, when days shorten mercilessly
and the nights grow in length with the coming
of the fierce season when the interminable northern
light makes life a burden hard to bear. His absence
of ten weeks was a slice out of the northern summer
that left little enough of a season in which the heart of
man can rejoice.</p>

<p>He had completed his work&mdash;that urgent work
which meant so much to his Corporation, and to himself,
and those who shared in his labours. But he
knew that the importance of it by no means ended
there. In the end it would mean the complete establishment
of the whole region, and the well-being of
those adventurers who had made it their hunting
ground. It had been ten weeks of enthralling labour
crowned by a success of which even he had hardly
dared to dream. All he had suspected, hoped for, all
the astute Peter Loby had assured him of, had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>
proved beyond any element of doubt. The greatest
coal and oil belt the world had ever known had been
definitely discovered.</p>

<p>It ran right back from within sixty miles of the
coast sheer through the hill country across into
Canadian territory. And beyond that it was almost
impossible to say how much it occupied of that chaotic
region. The work had been hard. There had been
times when breaking trail by river and portage through
well-nigh unexplored regions was almost fierce. But
nothing had deterred, nothing had deflected his purpose.
His investigation had been as complete as the
time permitted. And now he had returned to his home
on the bay with a rough draft map sufficiently detailed
for the purposes of obtaining at Washington and Ottawa
the coveted concessions.</p>

<p>But his return had been an even greater triumph
than that. After all, the work of survey had been
something prospective. It was a wide searching forward
for the future. It was something appealing to his
engineering mind, and would doubtless appeal to the
men of finance supporting him. But it would mean
infinitely less to those folk in Beacon who were yearning
for the immediate. The appeal of the immediate
was awaiting his return to camp.</p>

<p>The great news reached him on the river fully three
days east of his oil camp. It came by a special river
man who had been despatched to locate his outfit. The
man had been sent with an urgent recall. For the
lesser men in the camp, in the absence of their chiefs,
found themselves incapable of dealing with the amazing
situation that had arisen. A gusher had broken
out at “Number eight” drill. It was a tremendous
gusher at a drilling that had given no sign of the oil<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>
they were about to strike. It had come in a flood that
looked like thousands of barrels a day, a stream for
which their preparations were wholly inadequate. So
the urgency of the despatch.</p>

<p>That was more than a week ago now. They had
speeded home in a delirium of anticipation. And even
their anticipation failed to approach the reality. The
thing was infinitely greater than the fancy of the messenger
had painted it, and the difficulties of its control
were immense. But their presence was a tremendous
spur, and the genius of Loby did the rest. At length
order was achieved out of chaos, and all chance of
permanent disaster was averted.</p>

<p>Now McLagan was on his way to Beacon with his
amazing news. All sorts of urgent work lay before
him. But on one thing he was fully determined. Whoever
else must wait, Claire should be the first person
to learn of the triumph in which his work of this drab
grey coast was about to terminate.</p>

<p>His mood was a happy one in which to greet the
henchman who served him so faithfully. Little wonder
then there was a smile behind the eyes witnessing
the half-breed’s demonstration of human cupidity.
Even he found it difficult to administer the necessary
chiding. In a few hours’ time he would be in Beacon
with his sensational news that would send the stocks
of his Corporation soaring sky high. He would be
gazing into wonderful eyes which had been one long
tantalizing dream to him during the week of his labours.
He would be holding Claire’s fair slim body
in a tight embrace, and telling her of the great things
Fortune had cast for them. It was all so very, very
good to contemplate.</p>

<p>It was really all too good to permit of the obtrusion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>
of lesser things. But McLagan refused to yield to his
natural excitement. There were other things which
must not be ignored. And the sense of their importance
was the more deeply impressed upon him as he
contemplated Sasa Mannik with his collection on the
beach, and the desperate shape which had befallen the
pitiful wreck lying at the far side of the bay.</p>

<p>Even from the distance the inroads of the storming
tides were discernible. The battering of the vessel’s
hull was pathetic. There were added gashes in the
poor thing’s sides where her lumber cargo somehow
contrived to protrude. There was no longer a stitch
of canvas upon her yards to scare the sea-fowl with its
whipping in the chill wintry breeze blowing in off the
ocean. Whether or not this was due to Sasa’s depredations
it was impossible to tell. It might be. All her
gear was limply adrift, and her yards were lying sadly.
She was leaning at a perilous angle, and the tides had
driven her farther up on to the rocks. One real great
storm and anything might happen to her.</p>

<p>McLagan turned again to his henchman.</p>

<p>“Well? What you been doing besides loading down
the beach with all this junk?”</p>

<p>“I fish by the Lias.”</p>

<p>The half-breed had lowered his tone significantly.
And McLagan sought to penetrate the close mask of
immobility which seemed to have settled upon the
man’s features.</p>

<p>The white man permitted a shadowy smile.</p>

<p>“Did you make a swell catch?”</p>

<p>“Maybe, yes. Maybe, no.” Sasa shrugged. “I mak
big look for the man who mak shoot you all up. I
think big. Plenty big. I say, this man. Maybe I find
him. Yes. Boss all say plenty Sasa big coward. Him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>
frightened of fool jack-rabbit. I mak find this man.
Then I show him. I kill him all up dead.”</p>

<p>McLagan laughed.</p>

<p>“But you didn’t find him,” he said slily.</p>

<p>Sasa shook his black head.</p>

<p>“No,” he said simply. “So he live. But I find
some thing. Yes. I mak find cave. Oh, yes. It
camp for man. I know him. It all mak clean not so
as an Eskimo camp.”</p>

<p>He chuckled quietly. “Him all swep clean. So.
An’ so.” He took his cap from his mane of hair and
a sweeping gesture illustrated his words. “Maybe
him camp this man. Oh, yes.” He returned his head-gear
to its place. “I watch him. Long time. Yes.
No. He not come. An’ bimeby I go. Yes.”</p>

<p>“That was the ‘some thing’?”</p>

<p>“Sure. An’&mdash;another some thing.”</p>

<p>“Ah.” McLagan’s tone was interested but he
glanced away seawards. Then, quite abruptly, he indicated
the house on the cliff. “We’ll get right back
to home,” he said. “You can hand me your yarn as we
go. You’ll have to get food right away. I’m beating
into Beacon as soon as I’ve eaten. You’ll need to stop
around this bay till I’m through an’ get back. Guess,
since the Commissioner doesn’t kick, you can go right
on collecting your junk till the beach is like a ship’s
store. I don’t care a curse what you do so you don’t
quit it. See? The fish can wait.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>McLagan’s journey into Beacon was made at his
usual reckless speed. But unlike his usual habit he did
not drive straight to the Plaza Hotel. It might have
been expected that bearing such news as he was conveying
to the city he would have sought out the one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>
place whence its circulation would have been the most
rapid. Then there was Claire. A wild desire was
urging him to go straight to the square frame-built
home that had now become almost the whole focus of
his life. But he resisted it. For once in his life he
entered the city almost secretly. His speed had been
furious, and his ponies were well nigh tuckered out,
as, in the wintry cool of the evening he drew up outside
a remote livery barn that stood on the farthest
outskirts of the city.</p>

<p>The man’s plans were clearly designed. There was
no hesitation. There was no deviation from the line he
had marked out for himself. It was dark when he
turned his spent team over to the proprietor of the
barn. He gave strict and minute instructions for the
care of the weary beasts. Then he set out on foot,
and the darkness swallowed him up.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It would have been difficult to associate shadows
with Claire’s smiling blue eyes, raised as they were so
happily to the rugged face of Ivor McLagan. His
embrace showed no signs of yielding. It was an embrace
that expressed all the pent feeling of those weeks
of absence which haunting memory had so desperately
prolonged. Yet only a moment before his coming a
deep depression had reigned where now there were
only happy smiles. So it had been for much of
the time of his absence.</p>

<p>The girl gently withdrew herself from his arms. It
was as though the riot of her own feelings was such
as to demand restraint. She laughed happily. And
she strove to hold a torrent of questions in check.</p>

<p>“Why, Ivor,” she cried almost reproachfully, “I
hadn’t a notion you were within miles of the city.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>
When I heard your dear old voice laughing and jollying
Mum in the hall-way, I could have shouted for joy.
I surely could. When did you get through? When
did you get in?”</p>

<p>She moved to a big rocker chair and pulled it forward.
She led him towards it and McLagan dropped
his big body into it with a content that was shining in
every line of his plain face. Then she drew up her
own chair near to him.</p>

<p>“Why, last evening.”</p>

<p>“Last evening?”</p>

<p>McLagan nodded, and his smile deepened at the
girl’s tone of reproach. He spread out his hands in
a gesture that was meant to disarm.</p>

<p>“It had to be that way, kid,” he said. “It just had
to be. I could have beat it right along to here. But
if I had I’d never have quit to fix all the stuff that
helped to bring me along back here to you. Say, I
hadn’t a minute till now that I haven’t been on the dead
run. And when I’ve told you you’ll be glad. I wasn’t
getting around here till I could sit and bask right along
in the only smile that makes a feller’s life worth while.”</p>

<p>He eased himself in his chair. Then he reached
out and possessed himself of the arm of the girl’s
chair. His great hand closed over it, and, with consummate
ease, he drew it up to his. They were facing
each other, and so close that the polished arms of the
chairs touched side by side. He glanced quickly round
the sun-parlour. The door into the hall-way had been
discreetly closed by the mother, whose fondest hopes
had at last been realised. She had beaten a retreat to
the domestic quarters which conveniently claimed her.</p>

<p>The place still contrived to trap all the sunlight of
the late summer day. The full heat of the season had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>
long since passed. The wide open windows were no
longer netted, for the not infrequent night frosts had
done much to banish the torment of flies and mosquitoes.</p>

<p>Claire’s reproach had vanished. She was content.</p>

<p>“Tell me,” she said eagerly. “I’m just crazy for all
that’s&mdash;happened. It’s been so long, Ivor.” She
laughed a little self-consciously. “Oh dear, you know
I just hated the weeks till they’d passed.”</p>

<p>“They didn’t worry you worse than me,” the man
returned. “And yet, I don’t know. Maybe they did.
You see, you hadn’t the thing I had to&mdash;say, kid.”
He sat up in his chair. He leant forward. Reaching
out he took possession of the slim hands lying in her
lap, those hands he had so often marvelled over in their
deft manipulation of the cards in the Speedway’s
poker room. “I’ve hit the biggest thing this world can
show a feller in the work that’s mine. Gee!” he
breathed deeply, while his eyes narrowed as they gazed
into the beautiful eager face before him. “I’m through
with it all. I’m through&mdash;almost&mdash;with Beacon.
We’re going to get right out. You and me and your
Mum. We’re going where we can live in sunshine all
the year round, where there’s no skitters and blizzards,
and no muck. Do you get me, little girl? It’s right
up to you to hand the word. We’re going to get married,
you and me, just as soon as you say it. And for
the sake of all that’s merciful, let it be before the winter
closes down.”</p>

<p>Claire laughed happily.</p>

<p>“I guess you’ve fallen plumb off the main trail!” she
cried delightedly. “You&mdash;you&mdash;great big, queer old
thing. Now, you sit right back in that chair. My
hands are good an’ comfortable in my lap. You’ve<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>
got to sit around the same as if I was your most important
director, and, as my official mining engineer,
hand me your report so I can pass it on to the shareholders
and keep them good&mdash;tempered. Now begin.”</p>

<p>McLagan laughed. It was the laugh of a man whose
delight was sheer obedience to a woman’s will. He
obeyed her literally. He released her hands reluctantly
enough and sat back. Then his smile faded out and
Claire fancied she detected weariness in his serious
eyes.</p>

<p>“It’s easy making that report to you. You won’t
need the maps, and those figures a real director needs.
Here it is, kid. We’ve hit a belt of territory with a
world’s coal and oil supply in it. We’re in first and
we’ll have the concession before a news sheet can grab
a detail. That’s that. Coal? There’s hundreds of
miles of mountains of it within a hundred miles of the
coast. Say, in two years’ time, there’ll be a railroad
from here to our territory, and from here to the coast
where the mail boat only stands off at present. In a
few years there’ll be a city twice Beacon’s size right
down there on the coast where now ther’s only a fool
sort of landing and a bunch of longshore guys. But
that isn’t all, kid. No. That’s all to come. The real
thing, the big thing that’ll set Beacon whooping crazy
is right there at our borings. ‘No. 8’ sprang a
gusher on us. They’re capturing thousands of barrels
of the stuff. It’s the biggest oil flood I’ve seen
in fifteen years of a life mussed up in oil. Do you
get it?”</p>

<p>The girl nodded. A light of real excitement was
shining in her eyes and her oval cheeks were flushed to
something of the hue of her beautiful hair. She
breathed deeply.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes, I think I understand. Surely I do,” she cried,
and her hands clasped each other tightly. “It’s the big
thing of your life, Ivor. It’s your triumph. It’s all
you’ve been patiently working for. I know. We’ve
often talked of it. Work. Always work. Disappointment.
Always disappointment. And then&mdash;oh, yes,
I know. And Beacon. That city that’s always been
in your mind. That ‘muck-hole,’ as you’ve always
called it. In one bound you&mdash;you will have lifted it
right up to a swell prosperity where there won’t be any
need for the conditions you’ve always hated to see
lying around. It’s your complete triumph. Your big
thing.”</p>

<p>“It should be.” The man laughed without mirth.</p>

<p>“Should be? It is.”</p>

<p>The girl’s enthusiasm was met with a shake of the
head.</p>

<p>“I thought that way, little girl. I guess the notion
set me nigh crazy. The sort of junk I handed up to
the gods of fortune would have set you laffing if you’d
seen into my head when I knew about the thing we’d
hit. That was at first. Then I came along down to
home and stood up on that hill and took a peek below.
There was the wreck. It’s the wreck of the ship that
was bringing your Jim home. And then I guess the
gods for fortune must have got worried. I hadn’t a
notion of handing ’em up any more junk. The whole
darn thing left me cold. I told myself right there
ther’s bigger things in life than simple success. Much
bigger! And amongst ’em, and maybe biggest of ’em
all is the woman who reckons to move along down the
trail of life with you, and all the things that go to
make up her life. Her sufferings are yours, her joys
and sorrows, and&mdash;and&mdash;no, little kid, the sight of that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>
wreck got me right away. And I knew that the other
didn’t matter. I wasn’t through with my work. I’d
still got it to do. And so I came along. And that’s
why I didn’t get around, for all I was crazy to, until
now.”</p>

<p>The girl’s eyes had grown very tender as she listened
to the queer rough tones of this man as he unconsciously
laid bare his soul to her. There was no
smiling response. Only a nod. But it told McLagan
all he wanted to know. She, too, was caught again in
the terrible tragedy that had robbed her of a brother.</p>

<p>“You’re the first to hear these things,” he went on
quietly. “Not a soul else in Beacon knows a thing.
Not even Victor, at the Bank. No, I kept it for you.
And you’re going to keep it close till I say. I’ve been
on the dead run. I’ve been so busy ... but, there,
little girl, there’s things I can tell you and things I
can’t. Maybe there’s some things you’ll never know.
It don’t matter. The thing I want to hand you right
away is we’ve had word from Len Stern. Goodchurch
sent out word about that ship. He asked about it.
And the authority told him she was supposed lost in
mid-ocean. That was that. We knew. We’d got that.
But we were playing big. I guessed our only chance
of things was a hope of the message getting to Len
Stern, if he was alive. It did. The news sheets took
up our inquiry and it found him in Perth, Western
Australia. He cabled Goodchurch he was sailing just
after I’d set out for the hills. Two weeks back Goodchurch
got word from Seattle. The boy would be
along up right away. We figure he’ll be at the coast
to-morrow and I’m going right down to meet him. I
want his story bad. I want it. And when I got that,
maybe&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span></p>

<p>He broke off, and a deep, almost savagely brooding
light was shining in his contemplative eyes as he
surveyed the table that still contained the litter of the
needlework with which Claire passed so much of her
leisure.</p>

<p>“Won’t you tell me, Ivor? Can’t you?” The girl
had reached out, and, for a moment, one of her hands
rested on his, supported on the arm of his chair.</p>

<p>McLagan shook his head and the girl’s hand was
withdrawn.</p>

<p>“Leave all this to me, Claire,” he said with something
of his old brusqueness. “I’m right or I’m wrong.
If I’m right&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Again he broke off. And Claire saw the muscles of
his clean-shaven jaws constrict. Somehow the sight
left her with no desire to press him further.</p>

<p>“No, my dear,” he went on, with added gentleness,
“you carry right on. This thing’ll be through in a few
weeks now, one way or the other. All my own work
is fixed. When the other’s cleared up, then ther’s only
to close up my shanty at the coast and come right
along in to wait for my folks&mdash;my directors. After
that, we’ll beat it from Beacon. And my work at
Washington and Ottawa ’ll help to hand us quite a swell
honeymoon. Does that fix you? Will you&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>The girl nodded, and the man leant back again with
an air of great content.</p>

<p>“That’s fixed sure,” he said. “You’ll just carry right
on at your beloved Speedway.”</p>

<p>The girl shook her head.</p>

<p>“The time’s come for me to quit,” she said quietly.</p>

<p>Claire was smiling, but somehow her smile was unconvincing.
McLagan was sitting bolt upright. His
eyes had suddenly narrowed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span></p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>It was a throw-back to all that was roughest in him.
Again the girl shook her head.</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>The man’s tone was unchanged. It was compelling.
For another moment Claire hesitated. She remembered
the fashion in which he had hurled himself to
her defence before, and the thought of the thing he
might do caused her hesitation. It was the simple
truth, or complete denial. The latter was impossible.
She laughed a little mirthlessly.</p>

<p>“It’s the thing we once talked of,” she said.</p>

<p>“You mean&mdash;Max?”</p>

<p>Claire nodded.</p>

<p>“What is it? Tell me?”</p>

<p>“It was the night before&mdash;before I saw you last.”</p>

<p>McLagan nodded. His eyes were almost savage.</p>

<p>“He told me there was word of a hold-up for my
automobile. He offered to accompany me. He assured
me no ‘hold-up’ would happen with him there.
It didn’t. In the automobile he offered me jewellery.
I refused it. Then he said something. Do you want
what he said?”</p>

<p>“Every word.” There was a grim clipping to the
man’s words.</p>

<p>Accustomed as Claire was to fend for herself; accustomed
as she was to think and act without reference
to anything but her own judgment and inclination, there
was something that excited and thrilled her in the simple
act of yielding to this man’s will. It was something
so new&mdash;something which, for all her independence,
appealed to the woman in her. He was so strong. He
was so ruthlessly rough. But for all her delight in
him a queer apprehension lay back in her mind.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span></p>

<p>“It was when he left me at the door here,” she said
slowly. “What was it? Yes, I remember.” She
laughed. “It isn’t easy to forget. ‘I guess the hold-up
didn’t mature. I sort of felt it wouldn’t, Claire, with
me around. You see, the folk of this city have more
sense than to get across me. The toughest of them
wouldn’t take a chance that way. And they’re surely
wise. I’m feeling sore, my dear, you couldn’t feel like
handling that toy I was hoping to pass you. Think it
over. Don’t leave it the way it is. Get a sleep on it
and maybe, like the hold-up, you’ll think better of it.’”</p>

<p>“It was a threat?”</p>

<p>The set of the man’s face was a match for his tone.
There was anger, hot anger in the eyes which Nature
had designed so admirably for frowning. The girl
nodded.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes. And I remembered our talk. And I
knew it was quitting time. I thought and thought.
Oh, I thought so hard. I didn’t want to quit. I
wanted to&mdash;to fight it out. You know, Ivor, I’m foolish
that way. I’d got all the money I needed, but it
was the thought of quitting because of&mdash;because I’m a
woman and he’s a man. I didn’t quit. No, I went on.
But I refused his jewellery. I refused his every advance.
And then I realised. Things seemed to change
somehow, I can’t tell you how. The rest of the women
acted differently. The servants in the place. Oh, the
boys didn’t. And then one day Jubilee forgot to say
fool stuff. He didn’t say much, but it was characteristic.
He said, ‘The Queen is dead. Long live the
Republic.’ I turned on him at once. I said, ‘You
mean she’s deposed.’ His face was dead serious for
once. He said: ‘Same thing or worse. They’ve a way
of beheading deposed monarchs.’ Then his queer eyes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>
followed Max as he moved about the dance-room for
a while, and then he looked round on me. He said,
‘Say, Claire, why not quit with the boodle? It makes
a revolution sick to death when anyone gets away
with the stuff they reckon to handle for themselves.’
I guess I managed to laugh, but there wasn’t a laugh
back of my mind. I thought of you, Ivor. And&mdash;two
days later I got a queer note. Here it is. You can
read it.”</p>

<p>She took a folded paper from the bosom of her frock
and passed it to the man whose curious silence and
seeming rigidity while she told her story set a feeling
of apprehension stirring in the girl. McLagan took
the paper and unfolded it. And his unsmiling eyes
perused its contents:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>You don’t need to worry. The Light of the Aurora is
shining, and by its light all things are seen, all things are
known.</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">For The Chief Light of the Aurora,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><br />
A Lesser Light.<br />
</p></div>

<p>McLagan passed back the paper without a sign, without
a word. And the girl went on.</p>

<p>“You know that note’s given me a notion, Ivor. Oh,
I haven’t worried since I got that. And not a thing
has happened. I haven’t even seen Max. But I’ve
seen the boys one way and another. Those boys who’ve
never failed to be good to me. They’re just the same.
But to my mind there’s just one feller could have
worded that note that way. It’s Jub&mdash;”</p>

<p>McLagan stirred.</p>

<p>“Leave it at that, Claire,” he broke in quickly. “It
don’t matter who wrote it. But I’m kind of glad for
that note, seeing I was away. But I’m right here now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>
and you belong to me.” He stood up. He moved to
an open window. For some moments he stood there
with his back turned silently gazing out on the distant
dome of the Speedway.</p>

<p>Claire watched him. His square shoulders seemed
to fill up the whole of the window opening. He was
so big and strong, and&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>“Ivor!”</p>

<p>Her voice was low but urgent. The man turned
after a moment and Claire drew a sharp breath. His
face was almost livid with a consuming rage. He
came back to her and stood before her chair.</p>

<p>“I’m going to settle with Max,” he said, through
lips that scarcely moved. “No,” he denied, as Claire
was about to protest. “It’s up to me,” he went on
harshly. “That dirty Dago swine threatened you and
would have carried out his threat if those Aurora boys
hadn’t jumped in. Don’t you see? I do. Max would
have put a bunch of sharps on to you. He’d have got
at you by every trick of his dirty Dago mind until he’d
got you skinned of your last dollar and were ready
to squeal for mercy. Then, utterly helpless, he’d&mdash;&mdash; By
God! he’s going to pay. He’s going to pay me.
He’s fat and rich out of the weaknesses of the poor
folk of this city, is he? We’ll see. We’ll&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“No, no, Ivor!” Claire sprang from her chair. Her
hands were held out in appeal. The terrible purpose
shining in the man’s eyes frightened her. “Don’t do
a thing. My dear, my dear, there’s been no harm
done. Think of it. Thanks to those folk of the Aurora
Clan, I’ve a complete laugh on him. I’ve a fortune,
almost, in Victor’s bank. What does it matter?
Sure it doesn’t, and then&mdash;and then in the fall we’ll
be married and away from Beacon. No, no, Ivor,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>
don’t look that way! Don’t act that way. You scare
me. Besides, he’s powerful. He can buy up the toughs
of this place. You might get&mdash;&mdash; No, boy, I can’t
spare you now. I can’t! I surely won’t! Ivor, promise
me.”</p>

<p>The girl’s appeal was not without effect. The man’s
ferocity seemed to ease. And she almost fancied a
smile was somewhere back of his eyes. He shook his
head.</p>

<p>“Max will have to pay&mdash;me,” he said grimly. “You
don’t need to worry for me, Claire. Max can do
nothing to hurt&mdash;me.”</p>

<p>“But he can. He will. He&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>The girl’s protest died weakly away. She caught
her breath. A flash of thought swept through her
mind as she gazed into the stern, strong face she had
learned at last to love so deeply.</p>

<p>Then the silence was broken. And it was she who
was speaking again.</p>

<p>“Ivor,” she said, in low, gentle tones, but in a
manner which plainly displayed her resolve. “If anything
happens to Max through what I’ve told you, I’ll&mdash;I’ll
never forgive you. I know what I’m saying&mdash;I’m
saying it for you. Do you understand, dear? My
love for you is so big that I won’t have you fall for a
personal animosity. No, no! I won’t stand for it.
I want you to remember, too, that but for Max and his
Speedway I’d still be doing our rags of laundry down
on Lively Creek. Remember that. I’ve beaten the
game and I’m going to quit.”</p>

<p>The man raised a hand and passed it over his hair.</p>

<p>“You mean all that, Claire?” he asked.</p>

<p>The girl gazed squarely up into his hot eyes.</p>

<p>“I surely do, dear. There will be no&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span></p>

<p>“Don’t say it, little girl.” The man’s smile had
broken out at last. “I know. There’ll be no marrying
me in the fall. But there will.” He reached out and
caught her in his arms. “There will be, my dear, because
Max can go clear for me. I’ll not do a thing
since you ask it, since you order it. No, little girl,
don’t look questions at me, an’ don’t ask ’em. I can
see them back of your dandy eyes. I just love you
to death, and I want you to feel the game of life as
I see it needs to be a straight one. I’m quitting now.
I’ve still got things to do. To-morrow I’m going to
pick up Len at the coast. He and I’ll have big work
for maybe a week. After that I’m through, and I’ll
bring him right along to tell you of your Jim. So
long, little Claire. I guess that note’ll still stand good.
You’ll be safe till I get along back.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The daylight was passing as McLagan left Claire’s
home. He hurried away down the unmade road leading
back into the eastern purlieus of the city. He came
abreast of the Speedway which had so many turbulent
reminders for him. But he passed it by, and thrust
from him the leaping anger the sight of it inspired.
He crossed over to the Plaza Hotel where he ate a
hurried meal. Then, later, he passed again out into the
night and his way lay westwards where the moonlight
waters of the lake shone still and cold.</p>

<span class="fs95">The Last of the Moving Shadow</span></h2>


<p class="drop-capy1">McLAGAN was nursing his team. For once his
driving speed was moderated. But then he
knew the call he had yet to make upon his ponies.
They had already made the journey from Beacon to
the coastal harbour, which, one day, in his dreams,
he visualized as a flourishing seaport, the rail base of
a fresh route to the great interior radiating about
Beacon Glory. Miles away to the West lay the port
of Seward where the Government railroad, cutting in
to the heart of Alaska, began its hopelessly unprofitable
career towards Fairbanks. But no thought of
such a failure attached to the railroad in his mind.
Oil and coal would preclude all possibility of that.
Furthermore the vast capital of his Corporation lay
behind him. And lack of capital was the thing which
had so far made a failure of the Alaskan peninsula
which had at one time been known as “Seward’s
Folly.”</p>

<p>Now he was leaving the coast behind again, and
beside him, on the spring seat of his buckboard, was
the bronzed creature he had come in search of. The
man’s baggage was enduring the violent joltings of
the trail on the rack behind them as the two men
talked of the thing which had at last brought them
together again.</p>

<p>“It sort of seems like yesterday I was in Beacon,”
Len Stern said after awhile, gazing out over the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>
broken hill country through which they were driving.
“Say, I mind the landmarks as if I’d never quit. You
know, for all it’s a tough proposition it’s my home
country in a way. I don’t mean I was born here.
No! I’d hate to think that. But&mdash;Gee! I was glad
quitting Perth. Man, I’ve had heat enough to make
a feller need blankets in hell.”</p>

<p>There was a smile in the dark eyes of the man who
had journeyed thousands of miles to answer the call
which the other had sent out on the sound waves.
Perhaps his answer had been the more ready for the
fact of those memories stirring now.</p>

<p>McLagan shook up his ponies.</p>

<p>“Well, we could do with some of it around this
territory in winter, Len. But it’s a queer sort of
‘come-back’ for you. Maybe it’s tough. I don’t know
how you’re fixed. We haven’t had a deal of time to
talk that sort of stuff. But I fetched you along, and
I want to say right here, if it makes things better for
you, you’re my guest all the way from Perth to here
and back again, if you want to go. I want to tell
you I’ve hit a trail that’s likely going to set your eyes
wide, and make you guess you’re dreaming. But you
won’t be dreaming. No. You’ll be wide awake looking
on some of the worst dirt lying back of human
nature. I’m taking you right out now to get a look
at the <i>Imperial</i>, the ship your poor dead partner
sailed for home in, and never reached. She blew in
on this coast without a soul on board, and with her
name changed. And with&mdash;&mdash; But we’ll leave it that
way till you’ve set your two eyes on to her. And
meanwhile you can hand me some stuff I’m yearning
to hear about. After we’re through with this trip
there’ll be some more for us to do. But that can wait.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>
Then I’ll run you right into Beacon where maybe
you’ll be glad to hand the story of things to a lone
mother, and the sister who’s still mourning a dead
brother.”</p>

<p>The dark face of the man from Australia was
turned on his companion. McLagan had always been
a dominant personality to him in the old days. It
was the same still. His eyes were questioning, but he
remained silent. Now that he knew this old friend
was at the other end of the thing that had called him
back to Alaska he was content to await developments.
And McLagan went on in that direct fashion which
was so characteristic of him.</p>

<p>“Before I get your yarn I fancy handing you mine.
You see, the obligation’s all on me. I’m marrying
Jim’s sister this fall, and maybe that’s partly where
I come in on your play. But it isn’t all. No. This
thing had got me before I knew about that. Jim was
always a friend of mine, as you know, and when I
learned his ship had gone down, and he’d been
drowned it hit me for myself as well as for Claire
and his mother. Then when this ship blew in, and
I located that it was the <i>Imperial</i>, and she hadn’t
gone down in mid-ocean, it took me guessing hard.
Now the thing I want of you is identification. It was
you who chartered the vessel, I guess, and you’ll know
it again. And maybe you’ll know the skipper again&mdash;if
you were to see him. That’s what I want of you.
I’m reckoning Jim was aboard that ship with a big
wad of dust. I’m reckoning the skipper feller knew
about the dust and yearned for it so that murder
looked good to him.”</p>

<p>Len Stern’s eyes were on the sturdy backs of the
ponies. They were hard, relentless, as they contemplated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>
the sweating brown coats where the trail dust
lay caked upon them.</p>

<p>“He sailed with more that haf a million dollars of
dust,” he said quickly. “And the plan was he’d trade
it where he could, touching in at ports where best it
could be done, without too many questions. Julian
Caspar was the shipmaster and owner, and he stood
on a swell commission. He surely knew of the
stuff.”</p>

<p>McLagan nodded, and drew his team down to a
walk as they mounted a sharp incline towards a wide,
windswept plateau.</p>

<p>“So, feeling that way, murder might well look good
to him?” he said.</p>

<p>“Yes. Feeling that way. And Jim not guessing.”</p>

<p>“What like was this boy, Caspar?”</p>

<p>“All sorts of a hard seaman.”</p>

<p>Len sniffed at the fresh fall breeze which seemed
so good to him, as the buckboard cleared the incline
on to the plateau. An immense view opened out. It
was a broad, treeless expanse with a wide front of
purple hills in the distance.</p>

<p>“Say,” he went on after a moment, “I made the
deal with him. I collected him in Perth. And I’d say
he was a boy to fix himself right on to a man’s
memory. He was quite a chunk of a man, broad, and
strong and medium in height. He was clean-shaven
and rough. But the thing standing out in my mind was
his eyes&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Ah!”</p>

<p>Len looked round sharply.</p>

<p>“Have you seen ’em?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Maybe.” McLagan nodded. “Blue. Pale, queer
blue, like the eyes of some sort of dead fish.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span></p>

<p>“That’s the boy. Ther’ ain’t two pairs of eyes like
his in the world. You surely have seen ’em.”</p>

<p>“Yep. I guess I must have seen ’em.”</p>

<p>McLagan whipped up his ponies and set out across
the plateau at a steady gait.</p>

<p>“Now, Len,” he went on, “we got twenty good
miles to make before we reach my shanty. And we
can do a heap of talk between this and that lay out.
It don’t seem to me that we can do better than hand
each other our two yarns. Maybe you’ll be glad to
hand me all you can of the things that happened after
you quit here with Jim, till you got along now. Then
I’ll hand you the whole story I know. But before
you begin I want to say one thing. It’s this. That
half a million of dust, or the bulk of it, is coming right
back to you as the one partner left. It’s lying now
where no harm’s likely to come to it. Jim’s gone.
There’s no guess to that. So the stuff’s yours. And
that’s just between you and me. You understand?
Claire don’t need any. Nor Jim’s mother. Those
folks are my care. Now you can start right in with
your talk.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The two men climbed out of the lazaret. They had
explored the wreck from end to end. Now they
passed out of the alleyway under the break of the
vessel’s poop, and came to the main hatch. McLagan
seated himself upon it and beckoned his companion to a
seat beside him. Curiously enough the seat he invited
Len Stern to was the exact spot where once Sasa
Mannik had seated himself, and from which he had
ultimately fled in terror.</p>

<p>Len sprawled himself upon the hatch which was
lying over at the sharp angle of the vessel’s perilous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>
list. And his attitude left him in full view of the
litter of the deck which had resulted from the half-breed’s
raids upon the vessel’s gear.</p>

<p>There was a tremendous change for the worse in
the wreck. More than two months of every condition
of weather had made desperate inroads. The vessel’s
whole position had been detrimentally shifted. The
seas, playing on the broken hull at high tide, had
wrought havoc, and she looked to be only hanging
together awaiting the final belabourings which would
ultimately complete the work of her destruction.
Every removable article of her gear that had appealed
to the predatory instincts of Sasa Mannik had been
carried away. And she looked now just what she
was, a poor tattered thing awaiting her dismal end.</p>

<p>McLagan was scarcely concerned for the change in
her. There was no sentiment about him in the matter
of this ugly relic of a bad story. He would be glad
enough to see the last of her&mdash;now. She had lasted
sufficiently long for him to complete the work he had
set his hand to. No. The oil man was concerned for
other things. And now, as he sat beside his companion
on the hatch, his searching gaze was turned
skywards.</p>

<p>At the moment no sun was visible. But then the
sky was full of loose cloud that came and passed
under a high top wind. Just now a heavy cloud had
obscured the sun. It would pass. It was passing.
And then&mdash;</p>

<p>“It’s all like yesterday to me,” Len Stern said, as
he gazed out over the litter. “You see, Mac,” he went
on, with a comprehensive movement of the arm, “I
lived with all this days coming up the coast from
Perth. This is Caspar’s ship all right, all right. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>
was more than half crewed by Chinks. I wonder
what’s become of ’em. There were two officers, and
a third that was a promoted seaman. I doubt any
of ’em having officers’ tickets. I’m surely wondering
about them. Say, in that cabin there was only a meal
for one.”</p>

<p>His dark face frowned in concentrated thought.
After a moment he went on again.</p>

<p>“Those two empty chests in the lazaret are the
chests our bags of dust were stowed in. Jim and I,
and Caspar stowed ’em there ourselves. Ther’ wasn’t
a soul else wise to them. No. That was our play.
We couldn’t afford to take chances with a crew of
Chinks. I wonder. But the motor launches are gone.
Both of ’em. They cost me a pile in Perth. They
were sea-going craft for Jim and Caspar to use in
making their trade. You see, they could be run without
any of the crew. We meant leaving those darn
toughs without a guess.”</p>

<p>“I see.” McLagan’s eyes were full of thought as
they watched the slowly passing cloud. “You had
two launches? I’d wondered. You see the lifeboats
had been left intact. I didn’t guess there was a second.”</p>

<p>“You located one?”</p>

<p>Len’s question came alertly.</p>

<p>“Yes. Where were they stowed?”</p>

<p>“On the poop-deck. They were kept aft for convenience
and safety.”</p>

<p>“I see.”</p>

<p>Len stirred and sat up.</p>

<p>“Tell me, Mac. You reckon sure Caspar murdered
Jim?”</p>

<p>“Sure.”</p>

<p>“What about the&mdash;crew?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span></p>

<p>McLagan shrugged.</p>

<p>“We’re going to get that&mdash;later. I’d say anything
might have happened them. Maybe they were reckoned
in his murder schedule. Maybe they were glad
to get away easy in the second launch. But we’ll locate
all that&mdash;later.”</p>

<p>There was a curious grimness in McLagan’s emphasis
on his final word. And he glanced quickly up
at the sadly drooping yards as they creaked under a
puff of stirring wind. The cloud bank had nearly
passed, and the prevailing gloom was steadily lightening.</p>

<p>“I don’t just get how you located he’d murdered
Jim,” Len went on curiously. “Was it sort of circumstances?
He knew of the gold. You’ve seen
Caspar and know the sort of tough he is. You’ve
located the gold. Maybe there’s more back of your
mind than you’ve told.”</p>

<p>McLagan shook his head. Then he flung out a
hand pointing down the deck. The sun had broken
out, and the wreck was bathed in its generous light.</p>

<p>“No, boy,” he said. “Look right down the deck
there. You’re asking the way I know Jim was murdered
by Caspar. It’s there for you to see, and I was
waiting on it. Am I crazy? Are we all crazy? Is
that real or imagination? What is it, anyway?
There’s Jim, right there. That queer fool shadow
that’s trying its best to walk along towards us and
don’t ever get nearer. That’s Jim. I’ve seen him
before, and I wanted you to see him only I wasn’t
sure the sun would shine right. You see that poor darn
thing only haunts this deck when the sun shines. See,
boy. You can see it? Eh? It’s a queer shadow.
It’s the outline of a big man as plain as the eye can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>
see. And it throws another shadow right on the deck.
Am I wrong? No. I’m not wrong. Could you mistake
that big, tall body and gait, you, who’ve worked
alongside Jim Carver? No. Jim was done right up
on that spot. Maybe folks ’ud guess it’s a crazy notion.
But it’s so. I’m dead sure. And now you’ve
seen it you’ll be dead sure, too. Say, get a good look
and we’ll get back up to my shanty and eat. And
tomorrow we’re beating it right up into the hills
where&mdash;Come on, boy.”</p>

<p>But Len Stern was in no hurry to quit. His dark
eyes were held fascinated by the queer shadow. Could
he see it? Of course he could; it was there plain
enough for anybody to see. There was no question
in his mind. The thing was what McLagan had said
it was. There could be no mistaking it. He was
without any superstitious qualm. There was wonder,
amazement in his eyes, but none of the panic which
the vision had inspired in others. So he sat there
fascinated. That was all. And McLagan was forced
to urge him again.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It was a little backwater hidden in a rift in the
granite hills. Its mouth opening on to the waters of
the Lias River was a ten foot split in the sheer face
of bald rock. But inside it was quite different.
Within a few yards of the absurd opening it widened
abruptly, with sloping, funnel-like sides that were graciously
clad by a wealth of spruce growing up the hillsides,
and staunchly protected from the devastating
winds above. It was a remote, stuffy spot, humid and
dank, and a tangle of undergrowth profusely crowded
the water’s edge.</p>

<p>How far the widening stream ran back would have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span>
been difficult to determine. Maybe it was one of the
many little hill streams which went to feed the great
river at the time when the Spring warmth transformed
the winter snows. Again it might easily have been
one of those tiny recesses which have no other meaning
than the impulse of Nature in the remote years
of the world’s birth. Almost on the instant of entry
upon the widening water the ultimate was obscured by
the jutting of a hill slope. The course of the water
swung away round a sharp bend, lost amidst the
flourishing vegetation that looked to make its navigation
impossible.</p>

<p>Cy Liskard was standing on the bank at the water’s
edge. It was at a place where the undergrowth had
been laboriously cleared. The ground was a-litter
with fresh stumps where the cut had been made, and
young shoots of new growth were already seeking to
repair the human damage inflicted.</p>

<p>His boat was lying in the water at his feet. It was
moored fast to a tree stump. It was laden with his
outfit for a prolonged journey. But the man was
gazing about him with a queer look in his pale blue
eyes. It was a look of puzzlement, of incredulous and
angry surprise. It was the look of a man whose mind
has become well-nigh paralysed by the realisation of
a disaster of appalling nature.</p>

<p>He gazed out over the water searching stupidly in
the depths of the crowding vegetation. His gaze
wandered to the outline of the jutting hill which hid
the beyond. It turned back to the opening on to the
river in the same hopeless fashion. Then it came
again to the narrow landing upon which he was standing.</p>

<p>At last he bestirred himself. He moved back to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>
higher ground and sat down on a boulder. And his
eyes were turned upon the soft soil in which his own
feet had made such deep impressions. He followed
his own footprints to where he had first stepped
ashore from his boat, and quickly realised that there
were other footprints. Many others. A perfect
maze of them.</p>

<p>He drew a deep breath. It was the first sign he
had given beyond the curious expression of his usually
expressionless eyes. He was staring at a deeply
driven stake within a yard of the water’s edge. A
hemp rope was lashed about it. It was securely
knotted in a fashion he knew by heart. But the rope had
been severed, and its end lay close by on the ground.
The thing that it had held had gone. Vanished. And
he knew now that others had found this remote spot,
others had ventured up that narrow rift in the rocks.
Others had located the hiding place which had served
him for so long. Who? Who were those others?
And the mind behind his queer eyes was searching the
possibilities of the thing that had happened.</p>

<p>He remained seated for minutes that were rapidly
prolonged. It was more than half an hour before he
again bestirred himself. And in that half hour he
had searched every avenue of explanation that presented
itself to him.</p>

<p>He came down to the water’s edge again. He deliberately
cast off the moorings of his canoe and took
his place at the paddle. Then he headed the sturdy
vessel inland and vanished round the bend.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The day was well advanced when Cy Liskard reappeared
on the highway of the Lias, and turned the
nose of his vessel towards the sea. For an hour he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span>
paddled feverishly at a speed that flung even the ebbing
tide high against the bows of his little craft.</p>

<p>His destination was definite in his mind. It was a
picture that now loomed full of foreboding since the
thing he had discovered in his long concealed hiding
place. He came to the rockbound landing he knew by
heart. He swung his boat out. Then with all the
power of his body he struggled with the tide race.
Slowly, foot by foot, he gained way. The sturdy vessel
nosed into the stream making tremendous leeway.
But finally his efforts were rewarded. He drove up
to the landing and leapt ashore.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The man had vanished within the narrow entrance
to the cavern that lay back in the granite wall of the
cliffs. His boat was moored fore and aft to the familiar
boulders. The tide race held the moorings taut
and wearing upon the harsh surface of the stones.
But the little vessel was secure. Soon the last of the
ebb would have spent itself, and the period of dead
water would relieve the strain.</p>

<p>It was a silent world which the presence of the boat
made no impression upon. The air was alive with
circling sea-fowl whose mournful note only served to
increase the sense of utter loneliness. Grey and bleak
the wide expanse of the river mouth looked to be the
very gate of Desolation.</p>

<p>An hour had passed since Cy Liskard’s landing.
And in that time the sky had changed its aspect from
the brilliant light of early fall to the grey overcast
which the coming flood was bringing up with it. A
ruffle of wind stirred. It came chill and keen off the
far ocean, and a few driven raindrops splashed on the
bosom of the waters. It was a passing phase. It was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span>
that queer atmospheric effort which so much suggests
that in every changing of her mood Nature knows the
pangs of labour.</p>

<p>Of a sudden the man re-appeared. He came hastily.
He came almost as though he were reeling under a
physical shock. His soulless eyes were strangely
alight. They were frigidly ablaze with a light that
transformed them into a furious expression of the
mind behind them. His weather-stained face was
almost ghastly in its sickly hue. The lines about his
mouth were grimly drawn. He was breathing hard,
and the great hands that swung at his sides were
clenched with the force of a man about to strike.</p>

<p>At the cavern entrance he paused with an abruptness
that was almost a lurch. He turned and gazed
into the shadowed vault behind him. Then, of a
sudden, he raised this clenched fists above his head in
a terrible gesture of impotent threat. Then they came
slowly, slowly to his sides again. And in a moment
he started towards his boat.</p>

<span class="fs95">Julian Caspar at Bay</span></h2>


<p class="drop-capy1">CY LISKARD was squatting on his rolled blankets.
The interior of his log shanty was disordered.
For all the man’s physical roughness, for all
the conditions of the life he lived, his hut on the hills
above the Lias River had always been something
scrupulous in its neatness. Now its interior was completely
dishevelled. It was an atmosphere associated
with final departure, with absolute quittance.</p>

<p>But it was something more. It was as if the man
had searched it completely with a view to the destruction
of everything that could leave a clue to the identity
of its occupant. There was a pile of stuff lying
upon the hard-beaten earth floor awaiting destruction,
and outside the door a large fire was doing its share
in the work of concealment. Then, too, down on the
creek below there was a great smouldering heap which
represented the complete destruction of the elaborate
sluice box and the general gear of the gold worker’s
craft that could not easily be otherwise removed.</p>

<p>The man had done his work systematically and
without apparent haste. And now he sat on his blankets
gazing out through the open doorway on the devouring
flames of his fire. There was the pile on the
floor yet to be consumed. There was the removal of
his blankets and kit. Then there was the shanty itself
to be disposed of. After that&mdash;&mdash;?</p>

<p>The man’s dead eyes were more than usually expressionless<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span>
for all the teeming thought of his brain.
He was lost in one of those fierce trains of thought
which leave the body completely relaxed, inert.</p>

<p>He had returned from the river mouth at a speed
that rarely drove him. Apprehension had pursued
him every mile of the way. But it was not physical
fear. No. It was something deeper, more abiding
than that. He was beset with concern for an invisible,
intangible threat that seemed to be enveloping him.
A threat that was clear enough in its work of despoliation
without a sign of how or whence it came. Fury
was driving him hard. Fury, and that other thing
that left him groping for the thing he must do.</p>

<p>Now as he sat waiting for the fire outside to do
its work, he was contemplating the courses that were
open to him. And his mind and brutish nature, being
what they were, looked first and foremost for some
method of retaliation upon an unseen, unknown, but
not wholly unguessed agency that was operating for
his hurt.</p>

<p>No. It was not unguessed. Two agencies sprang
to his mind. There was the memory of those “fool”
figures in their hooded white cloaks who had surrounded
him while a rawhide rope dangled before his
eyes. For all he derided their methods they were not
easily forgotten. Then there was that other. The
man he had sought to kill, and who, through his
friends, had contrived to outwit him. A queer desperation
was driving. He knew he must act quickly,
at once. But even the feeling of desperation and the
uncertainty of the thing about him could not rob him
of his lust for vengeance. His lust to kill.</p>

<p>His plans had been urgently completed. He knew
he must quit his mountain retreat. He must defy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span>
everything and reach Beacon with all speed. His
credit was lying at Victor Burns’ bank. That was his,
which he believed no power could rob him of. He
must collect it at once. It was all that had been left
to him. And with that in his possession he would be
free to devote himself to the vengeance which looked
a thousand times more desirable to him now.</p>

<p>He rose from his seat and replenished the fire outside
with the collected heap in the shack. It was the
last. He had destroyed the last of his makeshift furnishings,
and only his camp outfit and his treasured
weapons were left to encumber his journey. And now
he sat again, having closed the door to defend himself
against the fierce heat and the smoke of his fire.</p>

<p>Yes. Beacon must be his first objective. It would
be easy enough. At the bank he was just an ordinary
customer. There was, there could be no doubt about
his credit there. He was wholly unknown except as
a gold man from the hills. There was nothing against
him except for the sentence of that absurd bunch who
called themselves the Aurora Clan. They were powerless
to interfere&mdash;&mdash; He stirred uneasily.</p>

<p>No. He would give them no chance. He would
give no one any chance. He would descend upon the
bank at the busiest time of the day, and be gone with
his cash before a soul was wise to his presence in the
city. Then&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>He dismissed Beacon from his mind and his thought
was caught and held where a wrecked ship that was
lying on the rocks at the mouth of the Alsek River.
And curiously enough the mental vision of it robbed
him of something of the even train of his urgent
thought. A queer feeling took hold of him in the pit
of the stomach. It came of a sudden, and he stirred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span>
uneasily, and strove to moisten his lips with a tongue
that had somehow become almost dry.</p>

<p>The stare of his dead eyes displayed nothing of his
emotion. They looked and looked squarely at the lateral
logs of the wall in front of him. Even the flutter
of the torn cotton which covered the window directly
above where he was gazing drew not a vestige of his
attention. And it was not until the loose cotton ripped
with a screaming tear that his gaze came back to the
things about him. He looked up with a start to find
himself gazing into the ominous ring of the muzzle
of a heavy gun. It was thrust through the aperture
of the windows where the cotton had been torn away.</p>

<p>“Sit right there, Julian Caspar. Don’t move a little
bit. Not a finger, boy, or you’re as dead as Jim Carver
you murdered for his gold.”</p>

<p>It was spoken quietly, almost gently, in a voice
whose tones startled the man on his blankets and left
him utterly unmoving. His queer eyes were fixed on
the dark face peering in at him through the aperture
of the window from behind the threatening gun.</p>

<p>But the whole position underwent a change on the
instant. The door was flung open and Ivor McLagan
thrust his way in.</p>

<p>“Up with those hands, Caspar!” he cried roughly.
And his own levelled gun enforced the sharp order.
“Right up&mdash;this time. That’s better. You didn’t do
it right at the Speedway. You’re learning manners.
No. Keep ’em up. Len Stern’s here and is yearning
to sift his hands through your pockets. Get busy,
Len. I’ll watch his monkey tricks.”</p>

<p>The man on the blankets gave no sign, and his eyes
helped the illusion of submission. His hands were
thrust above his head while he watched the man he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span>
hated most in the world. But Ivor bulked large and
fiercely threatening behind the deadly automatic he
was gripping. And the other had reason enough to
know there was no play-game where McLagan was
concerned.</p>

<p>In less than a minute the work was completed. Len
Stern, relieved of his hold-up through the window,
came to his task on the run. The man was deprived
of his gun and a pocket full of cartridge clips. The
rifle leaning against the wall was unloaded and put
out of harm’s way. And furthermore, a long, razor-like
sheath knife was transferred to the keeping of the
man from Australia.</p>

<p>“That all, Len?” McLagan spoke in the harsh tone
of a man without mercy. “We’re taking no chances
with the feller who’s done up a ship’s company. Is
he harmless?”</p>

<p>“As a babe.”</p>

<p>Len Stern left the man and moved clear. Then
he waited, leaning with his elbow propped on the
window framing while McLagan lowered his threatening
weapon.</p>

<p>The engineer’s quick eyes took in the details of the
dishevelled interior.</p>

<p>“Making a quick getaway, Caspar, eh?” he
snapped sharply. “Making a break for the open
where the thing lying back of you’s not going to come
again.” He shook his head. “You can’t escape that,
boy, not as long as you live. And when you’re dead,
I guess you’ll get its consequences. Say, a feller can’t
commit cold-blooded murder without it leaving a hell
of a stain, if it’s only on the brutal mind that designed
it. Can you guess why we’re here? Can you guess
why Len Stern’s come all along from Perth in Australia?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span>
Sure you can. But I tell you, in case you
don’t guess right. Len Stern’s got along to make sure
you swing by your darn neck for murdering his partner,
and goodness knows how many more. You can
drop your hands.”</p>

<p>The man lowered his arms and it was noticeable
that his fists were tightly clenched. His eyes displayed
nothing but cold contemplation as they looked
back into McLagan’s face. Those looking on, observing
his every movement with the closest scrutiny, were
not without a feeling of appreciation for the sheer
nerve he was displaying. But they were neither of
them deceived. A storm lay behind those cold eyes.
It was raging, consuming. And it was expressed in
the two fiercely clenched fists.</p>

<p>The man shook his head.</p>

<p>“You’re wrong,” he said calmly, with a shrug.
“You’re dead wrong. I’m not worried a thing with
any memory of murder. I don’t have to be. I don’t
know this feller you call Len Stern. And as for his
partner I can’t guess the thing you’re talking. I’m a
gold man scratching over the dirt of this creek. And
my name’s Liskard&mdash;Cy Liskard. You’ve a hold-up
on me for, I suppose, the stuff you reckon to get out
of me. You’ll get not an ounce. I’m quitting for the
reason the show don’t pay. Well?”</p>

<p>It was consummately done. It was too well done.
McLagan laughed coldly.</p>

<p>“We’ll cut all that right out,” he said. He
dropped back to the door framing and leant his big
body against it, but his gun was in his hand ready for
instant use. “This isn’t any old game of bluff. It’s
just cold business that’s going through as we fixed
it. You can keep that junk for the law courts where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span>
you’ll stand up to answer for your play. For the
moment the things concerning us are toting you right
in to Beacon, and handing you over to Alan Goodchurch.
Then you’ll be passed on to Fairbanks. I’m
not wise if they use an electric chair there or hang
a boy like you right out of hand. It don’t signify,
anyway. They don’t treat murder easy in Fairbanks,
which makes me feel good passing you along in that
direction. Your ponies are fixed for your journey.
You’ve set things that way, and I’m obliged. We’ll
be able to travel the quicker. You can get up off
those blankets. You’re going to start right away. I
can’t give you even blanket room on the journey.
You see, we’re going to make Beacon quick.”</p>

<p>But the man who had been called Julian Caspar
made no attempt to obey. He stirred where he sat,
but that was all. McLagan was watching. He was
watching with every faculty alert. He was looking
to read behind that baffling mask which was his victim’s
greatest asset.</p>

<p>It was that slight shift of position that betrayed.
It was an unconscious movement impelled by some
inner qualm, a qualm similar to that which had assailed
him when he had thought of the wreck at the
mouth of the Alsek River. And a feeling of satisfaction
warmed McLagan as he waited for the reply
he saw coming.</p>

<p>The man spoke harshly, but without any sign of the
fury that was driving him. He had himself under
a control that rarely enough gave way, and was
strongest in emergency.</p>

<p>“You’re talking a whole lot, McLagan,” he said,
“but you’re not talking the way of a feller who’s dead
sure of the thing he’s putting on the other feller.” He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span>
shook his head. “Try again. Maybe that way you’ll
make me feel like the boy you’re reckoning to make
me believe I am. A hold-up’s generally got more behind
it than seems. You see you’re not a sheriff, or
a law officer. You’re just an oil man. I haven’t seen
a sign of any warrant for my arrest. Do you get
me?”</p>

<p>McLagan smiled at the shrewd retort. He was
more than prepared for it. He signed to Len Stern,
while his gun was raised ever so slightly covering his
man.</p>

<p>“That’s all right, Caspar,” he said. “I’m not worrying
for details. You can think the thing you
please. We won’t waste time in discussion. Just fix
those bracelets right on his wrists, Len, and then go
fix his ponies ready for the start. No, Caspar. Don’t
move. Not a move. As sure as God I’ll fix you right
here. And I’ll fix you better than the mess you made
of things down at my home place. I told you then
you’ll hang, and that’s sure why I’m here now. That’s
it, Len,” he went on, as the irons were clipped on the
man’s wrists. “Now go and see to his plugs while I
look to him.”</p>

<p>The two men remained watching each other in silence
after Len Stern had passed out of the shack. It
seemed as if a tremendous silent conflict of will was
raging. The hard face of Julian Caspar was apparently
unyielding under the hate that no power of his
seemed able to abate. The eyes of the other were
harshly compelling, and kept the queer dead eyes of
his victim unblinkingly observing him. McLagan’s
decision was clear in his mind. It was impossible to
judge of the thing passing in the mind of the other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span>
as he sat with his shackled hands resting on his
drawn-up knees.</p>

<p>At last the prisoner shook his head.</p>

<p>“You’re needing something, McLagan,” he said, his
face slightly relaxing. “Maybe I can guess the thing
it is. Well, if you’re ready to hand out the price I’ll
sell what you need.”</p>

<p>McLagan drew a deep breath. Quite suddenly a
curious feeling of admiration stirred within him. The
man’s words and manner inspired him with a sense
of his own inferiority. His shrewdness and nerve
amazed him. He felt he had been read like an open
book. He failed utterly to realise that this man was
fighting for something he treasured above all else&mdash;his
life. And knew full well that it was forfeit unless his
wit should adequately serve him.</p>

<p>He nodded.</p>

<p>“I surely do,” he said quietly. “And when a murderer
is captured, and the irons are fixed right, there’s
only one price he can ask. That’s freedom.”</p>

<p>“That’s so. Well?”</p>

<p>The relaxing was gone from the man’s face. McLagan
read the anxiety lying behind that final interrogation.</p>

<p>“I let you go once before, Caspar,” he went on
coldly. “I told you then you’d hang, you were born
to hang. That’s why I let you go. I’m still sure
you’ll hang. That’s why I’m ready to let you loose
on this hill country again. But if you want me to do
that, why, you’ve got to hand me the story of your
ship the <i>Imperial</i> from A to Z. There’s no lies’ll
serve you. Len Stern and I know enough to check
you up all the time. You can only get away on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span>
truth. In return we’ll release you now, right here.
There’s the hill country back of here, and the Canadian
border beyond. It’s a dog’s chance. You’re
tough, and maybe you can get through. I don’t know
and don’t care. It’s a chance of a respite before that
hanging which is coming your way.”</p>

<p>McLagan ceased speaking and the sound of Len
Stern passing outside came in the silence that followed.
Then Caspar cleared a throat that was dry
with fierce anxiety. And suspicion lurked behind his
expressionless eyes.</p>

<p>“Why d’you need that story? What’s the dirty
game behind it? When a feller like you gets his
hands on a man he reckons to have done murder, why,
for a story, is he ready to hand him a getaway?”
He shook his head. “The price is right, McLagan.
But ther’s a snag somewhere. It looks like your case
is bad. It looks like you’re maybe a bad payer. It
looks like ther’s things to you you ain’t yearning to
have around in the light of open court.”</p>

<p>Again he shook his head.</p>

<p>But the challenge left McLagan quite unruffled.
His smile was derisive as his answer came on the
instant.</p>

<p>“That’s all right, Caspar,” he said. “It can look
just as it pleases you to make it look. I don’t care a
cent. The only thing is Len’s coming right back. I
can hear him. And so can you. The ponies, I guess,
are fixed. Well, we’re starting for Beacon right
away, or we aren’t. You can please your darn self.
The price will be paid or not, as you choose. But
you’ve only five seconds to choose in.”</p>

<p><ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;'Casper' changed to 'Caspar'">Caspar</ins> stirred.</p>

<p>“You swear to get out an’ leave me free?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span></p>

<p>“On those terms, yes.”</p>

<p>“Then you can have the yarn.”</p>

<p>“The simple facts?”</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;curse you!”</p>

<p>The malevolent fury in the man’s final curse was
the epitome of all his pent feeling. McLagan was his
one object of insane hate. And he was driven to bend
before his will. He knew the desperate nature of the
thing he was doing. He knew the risk of it all. The
evidence he was about to put into his hated enemy’s
hand. But he knew, being the man he was, and with
shackles on his wrists, that it was his only chance. So
he yielded. But his yielding had only come with his
recognition that the shackles holding him were the
official shackles of the United States Government, and
must clearly have been put into the hands of these
men for their present purpose.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Julian Caspar was still sitting on his piled blankets.
McLagan was still leaning against the doorway with
his gun in evidence. Len Stern was propped, as before,
where the cotton hung loose from the window
framing. The monotonous tones of the prisoner’s
voice broke up the stillness of the atmosphere of the
place. He had been talking for some time. He was
not looking at his captors. His dead eyes were on the
log wall in front of him. And his gaze suggested a
mind reviewing in sequence a series of pictures which
gave him not a moment of mental unease. He was
transferring his stock at a price. And only was it the
payment of the price for which he was concerned.</p>

<p>“It was too easy,” he was saying, with a sound that
was perhaps a mirthless imitation of a laugh. “It’s
queer ther’s such darn fools running around loose.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span>
That boy, Carver, and Stern, here, surely needed wet-nurses
before they set out to handle a bunch of dust
the way they thought. Why should I stand around
on a lousy commission with the stuff lying safe under
my hatches, and with only a bum crew of Chinks, an’
a few poor whites to deal with.” He shook his head.
“Not on your life. I’d have stood for equal share.
I’d have let that boy live for some other guy to do
up later. But he guessed to hand me commission.
Me, who was the only thing that could help him
handle his stuff right. No. My mind was fixed the
moment Stern an’ me signed our charter. There was
haf a million of stuff to trade, and I guessed I knew
who would do the trading.”</p>

<p>He paused and shifted his position. His audience
remained unmoving but watchful.</p>

<p>“I got him in the doldrums south of the line,” he
went on, after a moment. “It didn’t need argument
how best I could fix him. He was soft in his foolishness.
It was in the night. There wasn’t any darn
moon, and a thin cloud hid up the stars. There
wasn’t a breath of wind, an’ it was as hot as hell. I
guessed a walk along the deck would be better than
blankets on a night like that, and he guessed that way,
too. Then I’d got another thought back of my head.
You see, I knew the monkey tricks of the sailorman,
whether Chink or white. In the doldrums, without a
breeze, you can never keep a watch on deck out of
their blankets at night. The midnight watch came on
deck an’ the others went to quarters. Then us two
folks started pacing the main deck for cool. You see,
the moment the watch had changed they’d oozed off
for’ard and rolled into their blankets, and we were left
to the main deck where even the man at the wheel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span>
couldn’t guess the thing happening. There was only
the officer of the watch. I waited for him. He went
below to get a drink, I guess. That was my time.
That boy and me were away up near the winch. I
jerked that long knife of mine in through the neck of
his thick peacoat. It went deep and far, and he
dropped in my arms without a sound. It’s the Indian
trick of skewering a man’s heart, and comes easy with
practice. I heaved him to the rail and dropped him
over, and the thing was done without a mess, and in
a few seconds. Then I waited for the officer. I
treated him as he came out from the cabin, and got
rid of him, too. It was not because he knew a thing.
But I looked to make an atmosphere for those who
were to learn things later. Then I dealt with the boy
at the wheel, and left the ship with a loose helm.
After that I went below and waited. The thing I
guessed happened. The ship yawed and was set flat
aback. And in awhile I was shouted for by one of
the watch. I cleared from my bunk and raised hell
till he’d told me the thing that had happened. It was
a play game to me. It was an elegant show. I mustered
the watches, and looked for the absentees. I
located the first officer was missing. Then I got wise
that Carver, too, was nowhere around. Then I raised
every sort of hell a feller born to the sea knows about.
And in the end had the second officer log a scrap. A
‘hold-up’ by one of the Chink crew&mdash;identity unguessed.
And it worked smooth and easy, as I knew
it would when dealing with a bunch of sailor toughs
without sense between ’em the size of a buck louse.
Maybe it was&mdash;too easy.”</p>

<p>There was a moment of reflective silence before the
man spoke again. McLagan made no attempt to urge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span>
him. A queer nauseation affected him deeply as he
watched the man, who, now that he had embarked upon
his story, seemed rather to enjoy dwelling on the hideous
incidents of it. Len Stern was less calm. All the
youth in him was aflame. The cold satisfaction of
Caspar in telling of the slaughter of his partner drove
him almost beyond his powers of restraint.</p>

<p>“The game was only at its start,” Caspar went on
at last. “I’d got it clear cut in my mind. We were
coming up through the big islands, and at first I
thought of running for the China coast. But it didn’t
take long to show me it was liable to be a bad move
with twelve Chinks aboard out of a crew of eighteen.
I changed plan right away. I’d run for Alaska where
gold is found. I’d deal with the crew one way or
another, and abandon ship, and run the gold inland
by motor launch where its presence wouldn’t set a
flutter stirring. From the start luck ran with me, but
it was only later I was to learn how well it was running.”</p>

<p>“My next move was obvious to a feller looking to
lose himself and his bunch,” he continued, with his
queer eyes lighting unwholesomely. “I was my own
wireless man. It was mostly a hobby with me, and
I’d set it up myself. I got busy and sent out a distress
signal. I sent it out telling the darn fools who
picked it up I was foundering a thousand miles from
where I happened to be sailing. I kept sending it to
make sure, and I guess it didn’t let me down. As a
result my craft was fathoms deep in the South Pacific.
That left me free with leisure to fix the crew
when, and the way, I wanted ’em.”</p>

<p>He drew a deep breath and once he raised his eyes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span>
derisively to the frowning dark face of Len Stern.
Then he went on at once.</p>

<p>“I wanted that crew for awhile. We’d a mighty
big piece of sailing to do before I put the rest of my
plan into operation. It’s queer, now I think of it, how
my luck stood by. We steered E.N.E. after we’d
cleared the islands. And it came on to blow hard.
But it was a fair breeze, dead on our quarter, and I
carried on every stitch of canvas we could spread.
There were times when those darn Chinks groused.
They came aft an’ once looked ugly. But I didn’t
let go. No. I needed ’em yet. The only feller I
didn’t need was the second officer. Well, I took council
with the Chink steward I carried. He was a boy
who knew me good, and who’d worked for me since
ever I’d held a master’s ticket. He was handy. I
guess he was quicker with a knife than any yeller
mongrel I’ve ever seen. Well, it was blowing hard
and a dead black night, and when morning came and
the wind eased there was a dead officer overboard and
only the boy who acted as third and me to run the
ship. And so we came along up towards the fifties,
where we ran into elegant fair weather like spring,
for all it was dead winter. I guess the Pacific’s well
named.</p>

<p>“Then the thing that made me feel real good&mdash;at
first&mdash;happened. It happened at change of watch midday.
The bunch were waiting amidships to take over,
standing around smoking and chewing like the lousy
crowd they were. The sun was beating down fine on
the litter of lumber stacked on the deck. I was on
the poop deck watching those boys and guessing about
things. And in the midst of it I saw them boys take<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span>
a hunch to themselves peeking down the deck. I
looked too. An’ then&mdash;Say, you’ve seen it, McLagan.
Yes. It was there. Right at the spot where
I jerked my knife under his collarbone. It was there
just as crazy a thing as I ever see. But it was there,
and stayed there, just as long as the sun shone. I
wanted to laff. Then I didn’t. Then I thought hard
an’ waited, and pretended I hadn’t seen.</p>

<p>“It was two days later the play began,” he went on,
his manner becoming harsher. “They came aft. The
whole darn bunch. An’ I kind of knew the thing
coming. I was ready for ’em. I saw my whole play
in a jump. That queer thing had been there each
day, an’ all the time the sun shone. Oh, it made me
sick, their fool slobber. But I listened. You see, we
were near to the coast, and the weather was elegant
for my plans. So I listened. The darn ship was
haunted. That was their stuff. They were plumb
scared, the whole bunch, except three cold-blooded
Chinks who’d the nerve of the whole flock. I listened
and I agreed. I told ’em I’d seen it too, and was just
as badly scared as they were. But I wasn’t a darn
fool and wasn’t yearning for an open boat for the
sake of a crazy shadow. Then I pretended savage
and told ’em to get right back to their sennit an’ holy-stone,
or I’d dose their darn guts with lead. It acted
the way I wanted. They tried to rush me. I had
Jim Shan, the steward, with me. A sign from him,
and the other three Chinks lent a hand. They turned
on the bunch. And I unloosed. There was a tough
scrap, but we beat ’em back. When they were rightly
cowed I handed ’em the thing I’d do. They could
have one of the launches. It was a hundred miles to
Seattle. They could have the vittles and get. They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span>
went. And the darn third officer went with ’em. And
next day it blew a howling winter gale. I guess they’d
as much chance as cordite in hell. I was left with
four Chinks which included Jim Shan.</p>

<p>“We had a mighty tough time for two days. But
we were quit of that shadow. There were four of us
to handle wheel and sail, and one was a cook. But
the boys had shortened down before they went and
we had to chance the rest. Anyway we got through.
And after that the weather set dead fair and we
crawled up the coast. But the shadow came again
and somehow it worried me. Then I played my last
trump. I told Jim Shan the story of the gold, and
promised him equal shares with his friends if we got
it through to the coast. Say, those boys. Ever see
a Chink with the yearning for gold looking out of his
queer, snake eyes? It’s not good to look at.</p>

<p>“Do you need more?” Julian Caspar shook his
head as his queer eyes searched the implacable face of
McLagan. “But of course you do. You’re the sort
to want every ounce of your pound. Well, you can
have it. I’m looking for that dog’s chance for more
than one reason.”</p>

<p>He passed his manacled hands up to his shock of
hair, and tried to run them back over it. Then they
dropped again to his lap.</p>

<p>“The rest was easy&mdash;in a way. I set right in to
work to change the vessel’s name, and it took me
guessing hard. I had to think like hell not to leave a
clue. Those boys helped me, and Jim Shan was the
neatest hand with paint and a brush I ever located.
He did it all right. And the vessel was sort of reborn
the <i>Limpet</i>, an’ the name amused me. But it
was the waiting around and watching those Chinks.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span>
Say, ever waited around with a bunch more used to
knives than Bibles? Gee! Then there was that
cursed shadow. Say, I’ve got nerve. But there’s
things to break the best nerve if you only locate ’em.
It was that shadow. There wasn’t a day I didn’t sit
at that cabin table, with the alleyway facing me, that
I couldn’t see that shadow traipsing&mdash;traipsing&mdash;Psha!
I could have shut the door. I could have sat
elsewhere. But someway I hadn’t the grit to do it.
No, I had to keep an eye on that shadow all the time&mdash;and
on those Chinks.”</p>

<p>“Well, it don’t signify now. I’d got it all fixed
ready. We were making our getaway that night.
Then I was eating my food. I’d been sitting watching
the crazy antics of the shadow in the sun, and
sudden I got sick in the pit of the stomach. I quit.
I quit right there and hailed the Chinks. Well, those
boys lasted long enough to crowd on every stitch of
canvas. They lasted long enough to launch the motor
with the gold and vittles stowed. They lasted long
enough to clear the vessel’s side and head for the coast.
Then they died quick. All four got lead poisoning,
and I dropped ’em over the side. It was them or me,
and I knew it. I wasn’t yearning. So I pumped ’em
plumb up to the plimsol full of lead, and set ’em where
their knives couldn’t reach me. Then&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“You ran for the mouth of the Lias,” McLagan
broke in. “You ran in and cached your stuff in a cave
you didn’t reckon folks ’ud locate. And stowed your
launch where you didn’t see anything but sea-fowl
nosing.”</p>

<p>“You swine!”</p>

<p>McLagan nodded.</p>

<p>“That’s all right,” he said, straightening himself up.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span>
“Don’t worry for compliments. That’s not in the
story. Yes. I’ve got your gold. There’ll be embargo
on your credit at Victor Burns’ Bank. And the launch
is away up on the Alsek River where its use in my oil
workings’ll keep it in shape. But you’ve got your
dog’s chance. I promised that, and you’re going to
get it. It’s a hell of a poor-bred dog’s chance. Loose
those irons, Len. I’ll hold him covered so there’s no
monkeying. He reckons he’d like to translate his
opinion of me into something more active. But he
won’t. Loose him&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“But&mdash;Say, you’re not going&mdash;&mdash;?”</p>

<p>Len Stern, with his whole mind and body seething
with the horror of the thing he had listened to, stared
at the engineer incredulously.</p>

<p>“Loose him? What&mdash;&mdash;?”</p>

<p>McLagan nodded.</p>

<p>“Yes. Loose him, boy. I promised him that. I
promised him a run for it. It was the price of his
yarn. Leave it that way, boy. Loose him, and let’s
get out into God’s pure air. This place is foul with
the stench of his rotten soul.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>They were out in the open where the air was pure,
and the full daylight was pleasant to contemplate after
the contaminated atmosphere of Julian Caspar’s quarters.
The latter was somewhere behind them, free to
undertake anything his evil mind prompted. But McLagan
felt no concern as they moved down the slope
to the mouth of the Creek debouching on the broad
waters of the Lias River. It was left to the more hot-headed
Len Stern to concern himself.</p>

<p>“I don’t get it, McLagan,” he said urgently.
“You’ve let that rotten murderer free for the sake<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span>
of his darn story. You’ve let him free after murdering
poor Jim. Claire’s brother! The brother of
the gal you’re to marry this fall! It’s wrong. It’s
crazy. He&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>He broke off to gaze back up the hill at the shack
that was still in full view.</p>

<p>“I can’t stand for it, Mac!” he went on hotly, a
moment later. “We came here that that boy should
swing for the thing he’s done. You said that.
You&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“He will swing, Len. He’ll swing within twenty-four
hours.”</p>

<p>McLagan’s tone was cold. His manner was inflexible.
And somehow the other remained silent.</p>

<p>They rounded a broad bluff of woodland that
mounted the hillside, and all view of Caspar’s hut
was obscured. Now the great waters of the Lias
came into view. Its wide valley opened out in a
splendid picture of forest, and hill, and the smiling
sheen of the river’s waters.</p>

<p>“You beat me, Mac,” Len went on, in a tone of
puzzlement. All his protest had died out of his manner.
“How? He’ll hang in twenty-four hours? Will
you tell me?”</p>

<p>McLagan’s pace increased. He was gazing away
down at the great river. And suddenly a hot light
filled his eyes, and left them frowning.</p>

<p>“Len, boy, cut it all out!” he cried irritably. “What
sort of white-livered bunch of craziness do you take
me for? What have I been working for these weeks,
an’ months, but to hand that boy his med’cine? Say,
if you’d been here months back and seen that poor
mother woman’s grief, that poor girl’s grief, you’d
have known some of the thing I feel. Those two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span>
gentle souls are mine. One of ’em’s going to be my
wife, to live with me through the years of our lives.
That boy’s going to die the only right way for a
feller of his sort. He’s going to hang&mdash;just as sure
as God.”</p>

<p>He laughed mirthlessly.</p>

<p>“I can’t bring that poor feller Jim back alive,” he
went on. “But I can see that feller hangs. Why, I
owe it him anyway for myself. If he lived he’d get
me one way or another. No. He’s going to swing,
as I say.”</p>

<p>The landing on the river was in full view when Len
put his sharp question. Sasa Mannik was down there
with his canoe waiting watchfully his boss’s return.</p>

<p>McLagan turned. His face was unsmiling.</p>

<p>“That’s not for you&mdash;yet. Someday you may learn
things. Meanwhile get a holt on this. You’ve my
word of honour as a man the thing’s as I say.”</p>

<p>Stern nodded.</p>

<p>“That surely goes, Mac,” he said. “But tell me.
You see, you’ve got me badly guessing. Why for
did you send me out of that shack to&mdash;fix his ponies?
We’re on the river. We’re travelling by water.”</p>

<p>McLagan laughed.</p>

<p>“That’s easy, boy. The talk of ponies was bluff.
I didn’t have a notion of running that feller into
Beacon. Not a notion from the start. You see, I
didn’t let you know the thing in my mind because of
the questions I didn’t feel like answering. No. I left
you thinking he was passing right into Beacon. I sent
you out to fix his ponies because I had to make a talk.
And I didn’t want a chance of you getting hot with
the things I said and queering the game. <em>I had to get
that boy’s yarn.</em> You see, the thing I reckoned to fix<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span>
was justice, not revenge. Well, it would have been
justice handing him over to Goodchurch. But I
didn’t fancy that. The law’s queer and slow. It
would have been a worry to Jim’s mother, to Claire.
To all of us. It would have stirred up memories for
those women folk, and would have hurt ’em. So I
looked for better, quicker, surer means. But I’ve a
queer sort of conscience that wouldn’t be satisfied with
circumstantial evidence. I had to hear of the thing
he’d done out of his own mouth. So I offered him a
run for freedom to hand me his yarn. It was wiser
than it looked. You see, I knew the man. He knew
the thing he’d done. And he guessed what it would
mean going on to Fairbanks. Given a run, he’s confident
of making his getaway. His life’s more precious
to him than the chance he takes handing out his
story. I felt that&mdash;knowing him. My promise to him
was a run for freedom, and he guessed it was good
enough. You see, he didn’t know the thing I know.
Now the thing’s sheer justice. He’s condemned himself.
And the thought of his hanging leaves me without
a qualm or&mdash;scruple. Let’s leave it that way, boy.
I’ve given my word to you. Now we’re going to
make my home place to hand over your gold to you,
and to close up my shanty. Then for Beacon.”</p>

<p>“Shall I learn for sure&mdash;when it’s done?”</p>

<p>McLagan smiled gently as they paced down the hill.
He understood the other’s feelings. He realised how
hard, without further explanation, it must be for this
man, who had been absent so long from the country,
to accept his assurance. So he laid a reassuring hand
upon his arm.</p>

<p>“Yes, Len. And,” he added, “believe me, his hanging’s
as inevitable as that the sun’ll rise to-morrow.”</p>

<span class="fs95">The Quitting</span></h2>


<p class="drop-capy1">“ARE you satisfied, Len? Does it make you feel
good?”</p>

<p>McLagan was observing the dark, mobile features
of the younger man. They were alight with the look
he knew so well. It was the expression he had seen
time and again in those men of Beacon whose whole
horizon was bounded by gold and all it meant in their
lives. It was a similar expression to that which had
played in Len Stern’s features at that time when his
strong fingers had raked through the heaping gold dust
spread out before him at the far-off camp on the Australian
coast.</p>

<p>McLagan was more than interested. For the man
was gazing upon the goodly pile of smallish canvas
bags lying on the earthen floor against the log wall of
the hut overlooking the mouth of the Alsek River. At
that moment humanity was uppermost in the engineer.
A goodly satisfaction was stirring in his heart. And
his manner had lost much of that roughness which
was so characteristic of him.</p>

<p>Len nodded, his eyes remaining fascinated by the
thing they were gazing upon.</p>

<p>“That don’t begin to say the thing I feel,” he said
awkwardly. He raised a strong, sunburnt hand and
passed it back over his forehead. Then he laughed.
It was a short, jerky laugh that was an expression of
some feeling he had no words for. “Do you know<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span>
how a shipwrecked feller ’ud feel when his feet find
solid earth again?” He shook his head. “That’s how
those darn bags of dust make me feel. That, an’
something else. Yes, I feel I want to say all sorts of
stuff how I think of you. But I can’t.”</p>

<p>McLagan brushed aside the man’s desire to express
his gratitude.</p>

<p>“But you weren’t&mdash;shipwrecked?” he said quickly.</p>

<p>The other’s reply came with a laugh.</p>

<p>“It cost me all but my last thousand dollars to answer
that message you sent out, and&mdash;get around.”</p>

<p>“But you were on a big strike? You and poor
Jim?”</p>

<p>“Sure. The biggest in the world&mdash;on a fever-racked
coast that I don’t guess I’ll ever get near to again.
The fever got me. I only got away by the scruff of
my neck. And the stuff I took out did little more
than satisfy the dope merchants of Perth who did their
best for me. I guess I was shipwrecked both ways.
Physical and financial. Man, you’ve done an almighty
glad thing.”</p>

<p>McLagan sat himself on the cabin trunk just behind
him, and Len Stern flung himself into the chair which
usually stood against the table where McLagan was
accustomed to work. The small wood stove, radiating
a pleasant warmth in the chill of the late summer air,
stood between them. And Len Stern mechanically held
out the palms of his hands to it.</p>

<p>There was physical weariness in him. It was the
same with the hard-driving engineer. The voiceless
waste of desolate muskeg with its surface of shaking
tundra lay far behind them now. So with the wearisome
portage to the Alsek River meandering through
its coal-laden, oil-soaked territory of hills. The gateway<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</a></span>
to the ocean had been reached and passed only
that morning. And now they had gained the shelter of
McLagan’s home overlooking the bay, ready for the
last stage of that effort which had been crowded into
days that should have been weeks.</p>

<p>It had all been a whirlwind rush from the moment
of Stern’s landing until this return to McLagan’s
home. Stern was the least weary of the two. But then
he and Sasa Mannik had had the blessed break of a
day’s complete rest up at McLagan’s oil camp, while the
engineer endured an added gruelling in the work that
was his. He had spent the time with Peter Loby in
completing preparations for the time when the men of
finance behind him should arrive to set the seal of their
approval upon his achievements. It had meant a swift
change of effort for him from that which had been an
expression of a man’s deepest emotions to the sheerly
mental aspect of those affairs which represented the
material side of his life.</p>

<p>They had eaten the midday meal with which Sasa
Mannik’s indifferent skill had provided them. And the
whole place was a-litter with books, charts, papers, and
clothing, hopelessly mixed up with the utensils of the
meal of which they had just partaken. They were in
the midst of the preparations for McLagan’s final quittance,
which was to take place that day. It was a portentous
operation regarded without optimism by the
engineer. And Len Stern, while ready and willing,
found himself of little service.</p>

<p>McLagan lit one of his long, lean cigars, glad enough
to abandon his labours for a few minutes. Stern lit
and drearily sucked his charred old briar. The contemplation
of those bags of gold dust, that never in his
most fantastic dreams had he hoped to see again, had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span>
warmed his heart and eased the strain he had laboured
under.</p>

<p>It was all very amazing, and McLagan himself was
the most amazing thing of it all. It was all mystifying,
too. And as he sat luxuriating in the reek of his pipe
the man from Australia found himself marvelling at
the mystery in the midst of which he had found himself
so suddenly plunged.</p>

<p>He knew now that McLagan had been responsible
for the message Goodchurch had sent out. Even its
enticing wording. At the time he had read it in the
local news sheet in Perth he had not seriously considered
it beyond the reply he must make. Then had
come his arrival at the coast on the tubby mail boat
on its way to Seward. Then his meeting with McLagan,
and his instant whirling off on a breathless rush
that was only just about to terminate. He had been
asked very little and told less. McLagan had relied
on visual rather than verbal demonstration. He had
seen the <i>Imperial</i> again after believing the vessel to
be fathoms deep at the bottom of the ocean. He had
gazed upon some weird, supernatural demonstration
upon her deck. He had been hurried off to help in
the capture of the man who had murdered his partner,
and robbed them of the fruits of their labours. The
capture had been achieved and a confession extracted.
Then he had been called upon to agree to the murderer’s
release. True, he had the assurance of McLagan
that the murderer would not, could not escape.
But&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>And now he was sitting in McLagan’s home gazing
on the wealth of gold dust that he and poor Jim
Carver had washed out on the fever-laden coast of
Australia. It had come back to him. And McLagan<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span>
was the man who had recovered it. How? How?
How had it all been achieved? How had McLagan
discovered in the <i>Limpet</i> of Boston the foul tragedy
of his friend’s death, and recovered for him the gold
that had been stolen? The mystery of it all; McLagan’s
refusal to enlighten him; these things were utterly confounding.
In his own phraseology he felt the whole
thing was just “one darn mystery after another” and he
wanted to fling up his hands in complete helplessness.</p>

<p>But there was no outward expression of these feelings.
He sat gladly regarding that small, comforting
pile of wealth which McLagan had told him was his.</p>

<p>“I’m glad you’ve told me that, Len.” McLagan’s
smile was almost gentle. “We haven’t told much, have
we?”</p>

<p>“No. And sometimes I feel it ’ud be good to tell&mdash;things.”</p>

<p>Len Stern’s eyes came back from the pile of gold.
It almost seemed as though McLagan had broached
something of a deeper interest for him.</p>

<p>“Maybe it would. Well, ther’s Claire and her
mother’ll be yearning.” McLagan laughed. “And I’ll
be there, too.”</p>

<p>“Which is just another way of saying you haven’t
a thing you’re going to tell.”</p>

<p>Len grinned into the other’s face and shook some
juice out of his pipe stem on to the stove.</p>

<p>“It doesn’t mean just that, boy,” McLagan said.</p>

<p>“No?”</p>

<p>Len waited. Then he went on.</p>

<p>“See, McLagan, you’ve done a swell thing. Sure
I don’t want to say a thing to hurt. You’ve left me
guessing, an’ I’m content to go right on guessing if it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span>
suits you. You see, I’m just thankful. But maybe
you won’t mind saying ‘Why,’ if you object to ‘How.’
The only thing that finds me worrying is leaving that
swine Caspar free.”</p>

<p>McLagan removed the cigar from his strong mouth.
He rolled it between his fingers which seemed to crush
it unnecessarily. He shook his head.</p>

<p>“I’m not yearning to tell ‘why’ any more than
‘how,’” he said, with a return to his rougher manner.
“It wouldn’t hurt a thing telling it, except for the
laugh it’s liable to raise. You see, boy, I’ve a head full
of notions. Some of ’em some folks might reckon sort
of crazy. But they aren’t. They’re just a throw back
to something that’s in us all. The only thing is I’ve
given way to ’em, and they’ve got so that I have to
hand ’em best. One time I felt the only thing in life
was to make good. I’m older since then. I still guess
that making good needs to be done, but I get tired beating
the other feller. It kind of seems waste of effort,
unless the other feller needs beating. I’m glad for poor
old Jim, who’s Claire’s brother, to be able to hand you
back his dough. Then it’ll make things better for you.
You two boys were swell triers taking a Chink yarn
for gospel. Good luck, boy, anyway. Handle that
stuff right when you get it into Beacon.”</p>

<p>“I’ll do the best I know, Mac. Say&mdash;That oil play
of yours? It looks like beating every other feller. It’s
big. It’s big for Beacon, an’ the folks around.”</p>

<p>McLagan’s smile deepened.</p>

<p>“Sure,” he said simply. “It means so much I can’t
just see it all. This’ll be a swell country after awhile.
It’ll get oil-crazy when I let my story go.”</p>

<p>“They don’t know yet?”</p>

<p>McLagan shook his head.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</a></span></p>

<p>“They will when I get in this time. And I want it
that way. You know this country’s got right into my
guts. I want to set the decent citizens lying around it
whooping with the things that make life easy, and
pass ’em a time that won’t leave ’em yearning to muss
themselves with the dirt lying back of human nature.
What’ll you do? Quit for the sun places?” He
glanced down at the gold bags significantly. “With
that bunch a wise guy don’t need to worry beyond this
coast.”</p>

<p>“That’s so.”</p>

<p>Len was thoughtfully regarding his treasure. He
looked up with a grin.</p>

<p>“Maybe I’ll do what I know to get into your proposition.”</p>

<p>McLagan laughed.</p>

<p>“You’ll need to do it on the jump. In a month ther’
won’t be money enough in the world to buy our stock.
You haven’t seen a circumstance of what’s to come
later. Gee! I must get on with all this truck.”</p>

<p>McLagan rose with a sigh of real weariness. He
flung open the trunk on which he had been sitting, and
passed over to a pile of folded suits. He stood for a
moment contemplating them. They were clothes he
had never worn since he came to the coast. He picked
some of them up, and came back to the trunk. Len
rose to aid him. He moved over to pass him the rest
of the piled clothes. He picked up some of them, and
revealed a folded white garment underneath. It caught
and held his attention. It was voluminous. And, at
first glance, appeared to be some sort of bath robe,
or dressing gown. But the top fold of it had three
cut holes in it, which looked like the eye and mouth
holes of a mask.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</a></span></p>

<p>McLagan came to his side and Len heard a deep-throated
chuckle.</p>

<p>“Guessing, boy?” the engineer said quietly. Then
he added: “I’d forgot that, sure.”</p>

<p>Then he reached down and picked it up. He let it
drop to its full length, and held it out by its arms.
Len deposited his garments and gazed at it, grinning.</p>

<p>“Some suit,” he said.</p>

<p>McLagan nodded.</p>

<p>“Sure,” he said. And surveyed the conical, visored
hood hanging down, and the many rust stains that besmirched
its otherwise immaculate surface.</p>

<p>Then he, very deliberately, refolded it and looked
squarely into his companion’s eyes.</p>

<p>“Makes you want to laff, Len, eh?” he said. “Don’t
you do it, boy. Ther’s no feller needs to laff who sees
that.”</p>

<p>Then his own eyes became less serious, and a twinkle
of humour looked out of them.</p>

<p>“It’s just one of my notions. I designed it myself.
And I keep it by me to remind me. I guess it won’t
mean a thing to you, ever. Maybe it’ll just add another
guess to the things worrying you now. Set it
down a bath gown which you wear when you’re either
clean or want to be clean. But it’s another meaning,
another significance. It’s a symbol. That darn white
gown tells me every time I look at it that human nature
can’t ever be run right by academic theory or
sentimental slobber. The feller that guesses to persuade
human nature by argument is only one degree
better than the boy in the bughouse. The notion that
human nature is predominantly good is plumb busted.
It hands me a story of the unutterable weakness of the
modern methods by which human nature is trying to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</a></span>
govern itself, and warns me that the only thing to
bring about better conditions is to scare it plumb to
death first, and beat it over the head with a club after.
I didn’t mean you to see that thing, boy. But you
have seen it and I don’t figure it matters any&mdash;now.
Still if you reckon you’re obliged to me, why, just
forget you’ve seen it. Let’s pack up all this darn
junk. Gee! Ther’s a hell of a lot of it.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Departure from the bay was delayed longer than
McLagan had designed. It was delayed until the following
morning by reason of one of those fierce, late-summer
storms of tornado-like force, which at times
descended upon the tattered coast.</p>

<p>It started with a rush of wind sweeping down off the
hills. It came with the force of a hurricane, and set
the hut creaking and groaning under its spasmodic
pressure. For half an hour it battled furiously, shrieking,
howling, and crashing its way through forest, and
valley, and over hill-top. And then, as suddenly as it
had leapt, it abated into an ominous calm.</p>

<p>The respite was illusive. It was sufficiently long for
the men in the hut to interpret the conditions. The
sudden darkening of the whole of the western sky was
sufficiently indicative. Then the real storm broke. It
broke in from the ocean with the rising tide, driving
in direct opposition to the land wind. An electric
storm, it came with sub-tropical intensity, and a fury
of wind. The play of lightning was blinding; the
thunderous detonations were merged into an incessant
roar; and the suddenly opened heavens poured a deluge
of rain upon a darkened world.</p>

<p>The storm raged for hours. It raged far into the
night. And deep under the fury of it all the voice of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</a></span>
the sea came up from below like an angry roar of a
monster lashed and goaded to savage anger. It
boomed, it thundered, its echoes playing from cliff to
cliff, magnified and terrifying.</p>

<p>Clad in an oilskin, at the height of the storm, McLagan
sought the open. He stood out on the plateau,
and instantly his great body seemed to become the
centre of elemental attack. But he gave no heed. He
forced his way in the blinding rain as near to the
precipitous edge of the cliff as he dared approach it.
Then he stood there swaying to the buffets of the
storm while he strove to penetrate the grey pall with
which the rain enveloped the world below him. It
was useless. And so, at last, he returned to shelter,
and the exercise of such patience as he could command.</p>

<p>Dawn saw a complete reversal, a complete transformation.
A keen crisp northwest wind had set in,
and the furies of the night had been wholly swept
away. The sun rose glorious in a cloud-flecked sky,
and the world of the coast was as nearly smiling as
Nature ever permitted.</p>

<p>But the smile of Nature meant nothing to the men
who, ready to set out on their run into Beacon, stood
gazing down upon the bay. The wreck of the <i>Imperial</i>
was gone. Completely, utterly vanished. A
few baulks of timber had been flung high up on the
rocks at the foot of the southern cliff, but of the wreck,
in its familiar form, not a sign was to be discovered.
The ebb of the tide was at its lowest. The rocks on
which she had lain were bare. The vessel had gone
as she had come, on the race of the tide. But with the
difference that her shattered hull had been carried off
piecemeal by the victorious adversary she had defied
so long.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</a></span></p>

<p>McLagan was the first to turn away. Sasa Mannik
was standing by the ponies hitched to the laden buckboard.
He moved over to him and in silence climbed
into the driving seat of the ramshackle vehicle. Then
he called to Len Stern, who was still gazing down
upon the cemetery of that poor restless shadow of the
man who had been his friend and partner.</p>

<span class="fs95">The Passing of the “Chief-Light”</span></h2>


<p class="drop-capy1">REBECCA CARVER was primly seated at one
end of a well-upholstered couch. Her slight
form was very erect, very much supported in garments
that seemed somehow strange to it. Her dark eyes
were steadily fixed upon the work in her hands, and the
expression of them was carefully concealed. Her
greying hair was neatly dressed for the occasion, and
she looked to be holding herself schooled for the moment,
and the unaccustomed surroundings in which
she found herself.</p>

<p>It was a seat she rarely enough occupied. But then
the parlour of her frame home had no appeal for her.
She somehow felt she belonged to other spheres, to
another life than that to which the adventurous genius
of her daughter Claire had so suddenly elevated her.
Still, she did her best staunchly enough for all there
were times when she wondered, times when she had
been almost terrified at the thought of the crash in
their fortunes which must inevitably come. But perhaps
the greatest strain of all was her thought for
Claire herself, her dread for her moral undoing. Hers
was the mother’s lot when the reins pass from her
hands, and advancing years bring the slow decay of
her authority.</p>

<p>Her black silk gown left her feeling wholly self-conscious.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</a></span>
Never in her hard-lived life had she possessed
anything quite so splendid. And somehow the
rustle of it was pleasant to her simple mind, and she
hoped fervently that a prolonged sitting would not
completely “muss” it. A silk workbag was beside
her on the couch, and her hard-worn hands were
busily plying knitting-needles whose homely click afforded
her no small measure of encouragement.</p>

<p>Len Stern was talking from a highly polished chair
opposite her. He had been talking for some time, and
seemed to be addressing her particularly. The play of
his dark eyes was vividly expressive of the thrilling
details of the long story he had had to tell to the
mother of his dead friend, while the two others in
the room seemed, for the time being, to have no claim
upon him.</p>

<p>Ivor McLagan was standing at a window with his
back turned, labouring under a feeling that his presence
was something of an intrusion upon that which
should have been sacred to the bereaved mother. But
he knew he must be there for clear and definite reasons,
and so he persisted. Claire was near to him.
There could be no question of her greed for the story
she was listening to. Her blue eyes were wide with
almost painful interest. Her hands, those slender hands
which were the admiration of all at the Speedway,
were tightly clasped in her lap. She was leaning
forward eagerly, and hanging intently upon every word
the man uttered.</p>

<p>Len Stern had told all the story of the gold discovery,
and of the drear life of that fever-ridden coast.
He had told of his desperate journey to secure a man
and a ship to serve their purpose. He had told of the
great day when the shipment was made, and he bade<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</a></span>
farewell to the loyal creature, who was thrilling with
the thought of all that their wealth would mean to his
women-folk at home, and had reached the point of
his narrative where he was standing on the beach
watching the breaking out of the vessel’s sails as she
put to sea.</p>

<p>“It was a great day, ma’am,” he said, with a smile
that was deeply reminiscent. “You just can’t think the
greatness of it. That boy, he was good grit. Gold?
Yes, he wanted that gold, his share. But it was only
for the folks at home. The mother and the sister he’d
left behind. His whole thought, ma’am, all the time
was for you.”</p>

<p>The mother sniffed violently, and a work-worn hand
brushed aside a tear that blurred the stitches of her
knitting. The next moment the click of her needles
came more rapidly.</p>

<p>“I got back to work&mdash;alone,” Len went on. Then
he drew a deep sigh which ended in an expletive.
“Gee! How I worked.” He laughed. “It’s queer
how hard a boy can work when he’s alone, an’ trying
to keep from going crazy. That’s how it was with
me. Why, I must have got out an’ washed a million
dollars of stuff before it happened. Gold? Why, the
whole of that river bed was gold from end to end.
There’s the gold of the world there, an’ one day some
bunch’ll get around and clear out the fever, and just
snow the world’s market right under with the stuff.
But it wasn’t for me&mdash;or Jim. That fever hit me
within two weeks of Jim’s quitting. It came slow,
it made me sick, and I was wise to it. You see, the
Chink had told us. Well, it didn’t take me two jumps
to reckon the thing I must do. I knew I must get out
right away. I must beat it in that shell of a smack of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</a></span>
ours down the coast to Perth, the same as I’d done
before. I’d just have to get there and wait around for
Jim to get back. It was a big chance, I was getting
sicker every hour. But I had to take it. So I loaded
all the dust I could take, cached the rest, stowed my
kit, and&mdash;drove out to sea.”</p>

<p>He drew a deep breath as the memory of things
stirred him. McLagan had turned regarding him.
Even Claire, who had sat almost immovable, stirred
restlessly. Then he went on to the accompaniment of
the click of the mother’s needles.</p>

<p>“Maybe it saved me. I don’t know. Y’see, the sea
air’s clean, and likely it helped. Anyway I was full
of fever and pains, and wanted to lie around all the
while, but I didn’t. I had to make the course I knew,
and the will of it all drove me. I can’t reckon even
now how long it was, or how I ever reached Perth
right. But I reached it in the end after storm, and
calm, and sickness. But I’d lost a big bunch of my
stuff. You see, I had to fight myself as well as the
weather. I was swamped out and nearly plumb
wrecked a dozen times. When I did get in I was
nigher dead than alive, and they set me right into hospital.</p>

<p>“It was tough. And before they were through with
me it had cost me most of my stuff. Still I wasn’t
worried with that, there was plenty more, and, when
Jim came back and I was feeling good, why, it would
be easy. Quite easy for all I was scared to death of
that coast.”</p>

<p>He passed a hand back over his dark hair.</p>

<p>“But time went on an’ I never heard a word. And
then&mdash;and then came word of&mdash;Jim’s ship. It set me
nigh crazy. I waited, and thought, and worried. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</a></span>
never got another word. Then I thought to send you
folks word. Then I was scared to do it. Ma’am, you
don’t know the way I felt. Jim gone&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Drowned. Drowned right in mid-ocean.”</p>

<p>McLagan’s voice broke in harshly, and Len glanced
round quickly. Claire, too, turned. She looked up,
a sharp question in her eyes.</p>

<p>McLagan nodded.</p>

<p>“It hit you, Len boy, to know Jim was&mdash;drowned.
It hit us folks, too.”</p>

<p>Len turned again to the mother who was gazing at
him from behind a mist of tears.</p>

<p>“Say, ma’am, it hit us all bad, to know Jim was
drowned with the sinking of that ship in mid-ocean.
It hurts me now to think of it. An’ God knows the way
it must hurt you folks. But I didn’t get along to stir
up bad memories. I came to tell Jim’s mother of the
wonderful boy Jim was, and make her feel pride in his
grit, an’ honesty, and&mdash;and the hell of a fine partner he
was to me. He was plumb gold all through. Bright
shining gold. He’d got just one notion in the world,
ma’am. It was for his mother and his sister. After
them came his partner. You know, ma’am, someways
I feel, and I’d be glad to know you feel it, too, Jim
came by his death doing one great big act. He’d
sweated and laboured, and he was carrying home all
the fruit of the love of his big heart to his&mdash;mother.
Does it make you feel good? Yes, sure it does. I can
see&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>The mother had flung her knitting aside. Her work-worn
hands were thrust up covering her tear-streaming
eyes. She sprang to her feet and stood sobbing
for a moment. Then Claire came to her side, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</a></span>
with one warm arm flung about the older woman’s
shaking shoulders, she led her from the room.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Claire and McLagan were walking down the dusty,
unpaved road in the direction of the city’s main highway.
Len Stern had already departed to transact his
business at Victor Burns’ bank. The mother had gone
back to the work that always claimed her, comforted
far more than she knew by the revelation of the staunch
devotion of her dead son.</p>

<p>Once clear of the house Claire raised her wide questioning
eyes to the face of the man beside her.</p>

<p>“Why did you jump in while Len was talking?” she
asked abruptly. “Why did you remind him that Jim
was&mdash;drowned?”</p>

<p>McLagan’s reply came on the instant.</p>

<p>“Because he wasn’t drowned, and&mdash;Len knows it.”</p>

<p>“Murdered?”</p>

<p>“Sure.”</p>

<p>“Then why not say it? Why&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Say, Claire,” McLagan broke in with that roughness
she knew so well, “do you think I’d brought Len
along to tell your Mum that Jim was foully murdered
and robbed? No. I know it. You know it. We’re
young and strong, and it’s not going to hurt us, seeing
poor Jim is dead anyway. But she’s his mother.
Think, my dear, just think. Len and I fixed it up to
say that. I jumped, scared he might blurt out the
truth. Jim’s mother is some one we both love. Right
deep in her heart now is the swell thought of all that
boy was trying to do for her. He died doing it. To
her there’s no picture of a foul murder with the murderer
standing over him and robbing him. Don’t you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</a></span>
see? Sure you do. For all her tears I guess we’ve
left Jim’s mother a mighty happy woman. An’ she’ll
never be told the thing that really happened.”</p>

<p>The girl made no reply. Somehow the man’s
harshly spoken rebuke thrilled her as no word of his
had ever thrilled her before. Her love for him rose
to something like worship as she regarded his plain
face and thought of the world of kindly sympathy
lying behind it. Her next words were almost humble.</p>

<p>“And the murderer?”</p>

<p>“Is dead. Hanged by the neck, and&mdash;dead.”</p>

<p>The intensity, the biting ruthlessness of the man’s
tone, was in flat contradiction of his recent mood.</p>

<p>“Then what you thought&mdash;what you hoped of Len’s
coming&mdash;proved out?”</p>

<p>“Surely.”</p>

<p>“Does Len know? Did he&mdash;help?”</p>

<p>“Len has my assurance. That’s all.”</p>

<p>“Will I ever know the whole thing&mdash;you know?”</p>

<p>McLagan smiled upon the dingy habitations about
him.</p>

<p>“Maybe some day,” he said. “But&mdash;not right now.
It’s a bad story.”</p>

<p>They had turned out of the side road, and on to the
sidewalk of the main thoroughfare. It was still within
the business hours of the place, and as Claire gazed
about her a certain unusual movement was observable
among the people. She drew a deep sigh.</p>

<p>“Sometimes I think it awful in me,” she said, a
little desperately. “He’s dead. Hanged. The man
who murdered Jim. I’m&mdash;glad. Yes,” she went on
a little defiantly, “I’m glad. And Jim’s gold?”</p>

<p>“Recovered&mdash;most of it. And passed to the feller
it rightly belongs. Len Stern. That boy needs it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</a></span>
You don’t, Claire. Your mother don’t. You’re both&mdash;my
affair.”</p>

<p>“Yes. We don’t need it&mdash;anyway.”</p>

<p>McLagan smiled at the little touch of independence
in the girl’s words.</p>

<p>They were approaching the Plaza with its balcony
and its loungers. He could see the face of Jubilee
Hurst leaning out gazing in their direction. And he
knew the thing that was coming.</p>

<p>Jubilee’s challenge came on the instant of their approach.
It came full of all that irresponsible lightness
which masked the real seriousness of the man.</p>

<p>“Ho, Mac!” he cried. “Is it true? Is it real, or
have I got a bad nightmare? I’ve turned over a couple
of times but it’s still the same. I can’t get away from
the messy sight of crude oil streaming all through the
streets of Beacon. Is it true? Or are you yearning
to see us poor folk plumb bug?”</p>

<p>Claire and McLagan smiled up into eager face.
They realised the presence of the others on the veranda.
There was Abe Cranfield. And Burt Riddell
was gloomily inquiring as he leant over the rail beside
his partner.</p>

<p>“It’s all true.”</p>

<p>It was Claire who replied. She nodded laughingly.
And in her eyes was a gladness that illuminated her
whole countenance. Then she indicated the man beside
her.</p>

<p>“You see, Ivor’s got the close habit, and I guess it
isn’t easy for him to say ‘yes.’ Maybe now I’ve saved
you getting bug he can hand you the rest.”</p>

<p>McLagan nodded.</p>

<p>“I guessed you’d be wise in a half-hour. That’s why
I chose Doc Finch to hand out the news. He’s better<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</a></span>
than a hundred telephones. Yes, boy, it’s all true.
There’s oil enough to float a ship. Get in, if you’ve
two cents to buy with. Maybe there’s weeks of grace
while my folks play the market. So get in, or our
stocks’ll jump sky high. You’ll find it more profitable
than a hand at Claire’s table.”</p>

<p>Jubilee eyed the girl. He realised the wonderful
light shining in her pretty eyes. But it was the sad
voice of Burt Riddell that answered him.</p>

<p>“Maybe it’s more profitable. But me for the hand
at Claire’s table. Say, you ain’t going to rob us of
that?”</p>

<p>McLagan laughed outright.</p>

<p>“When it comes to guessing I’d say you’ve Jubilee
beat a mile.”</p>

<p>“What d’you mean?” Jubilee looked from one to
the other and grinned. “Burt got me beat guessing?”
He shook his head. “Not on your life, Mac. I didn’t
have to guess. I&mdash;knew. Say, it beats hell. My best
to you both, Claire. The Speedway’ll be hell without
you, but&mdash;Gee, I must go count my cents. It don’t
seem right, buying oil with ’em when I’m yearning to
hand you a swell bouquet. Say, look down the sidewalk.
See the folks? Doc’s sure been busy. Well, so
long. Will you be around at the Speedway to-night?
‘<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Bon</i>,’ as we used to say in France,” he cried, as the
engineer nodded. “It’ll beat Max’s festival to the
bone. Come on, Burt. Let’s get a look at our cents
and see how best we can roll Victor to help things
out.”</p>

<p>Claire and McLagan passed on, and the sight of the
engineer caused a commotion and excitement that had
been unknown in Beacon since the early days of the
boom. It was as McLagan had said it would be. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</a></span>
town was already oil-crazy. The man’s progress was
something in the nature of a triumphal procession.
There were smiles, and greeting, and handshakes, almost
every step of the way, till McLagan felt something
like serious regret that he had utilised the
rotund doctor as a medium for disseminating his
news.</p>

<p>As they came to the bank, McLagan’s patience had
well-nigh exhausted itself.</p>

<p>“We’ll get right inside for shelter, kid,” he said in
desperation. “This popularity makes me sick. This
darn handwagging with folks I don’t know from a
bunch of fence posts couldn’t be worse if I was President
of the United States. Say&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>He laughed as he discovered that Victor Burns was
standing in the doorway of the bank obviously waiting
for him to come up.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>They were safe for the moment in Victor’s private
office. The banker was sitting behind his desk while
Claire was occupying the most comfortable chair the
place afforded. McLagan was propped on the corner
of the desk listening to the thing the banker had to
tell.</p>

<p>“I’m glad for you, McLagan,” he said. “I’m glad
for Beacon. And it didn’t take me two seconds to
guess my own feelings the moment Doc blew in and
handed me his story of an oil flood that nearly
wrecked your camp. I’ve a private bunch of dollars
that’s going to be changed into your Corporation’s
stock right away. Yes, boy, I’m glad, but I’m worried.”</p>

<p>“How?”</p>

<p>“How?” The banker looked from one to the other.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</a></span>
Then he raised a clenched fist and brought it heavily
down on his desk. A frown of unusual ill-temper had
suddenly depressed his pleasant face. “It’s this boy,
Cy Liskard, a customer of mine, you’ll remember him.
It’s that guy with the gold I showed you awhile back.
The feller that you spread out on the Speedway floor
on the night of the festival. They’ve hanged him,
they’ve hanged him clean out of hand. It’s these boys,
the Aurora bunch. And they ticketed him with their
fancy label with the signature of the Chief Light.”</p>

<p>He snorted as he sat gazing into McLagan’s face.
Claire sat up in her chair, a startled look in her eyes
as she watched the unsmiling face of the man she
loved.</p>

<p>“That don’t seem a thing to worry for,” McLagan
said coldly. “Where did they hang him? What
for?”</p>

<p>“Where? What for?” The banker shook his head.
“They hanged him right here just beyond the town
limits on the lakeside. What for? I haven’t a notion,
unless it was a hold-up for his stuff. Here, you don’t
get me&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“It hasn’t been their way to hold a boy up for his
stuff,” McLagan broke in quickly. “Was he coming
in with a bunch of dust?”</p>

<p>The banker shook his head. He spread out a pair
of helpless hands.</p>

<p>“I can’t say a thing,” he declared peevishly. “Here,
I’ll tell you. Goodchurch came along this morning;
he jumped in on me and I asked him things;
he said he was guessing as badly as I was. One of
his men come in and brought him word a feller was
hanging under the spread of a Western Cedar, and
was labelled by this precious bunch. Looked like he’d<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</a></span>
been hanging there days. He sent out to investigate
and found it was this boy from the Lias, who’s been
toting dust in since last fall. He asked me what I
knew, and I told him of his credit here. He’s set a
government ‘hold-up’ on it, and went off cursing these
Aurora folk in a way I’d hate to repeat before a lady.
I’m sick, I’m good an’ sick. I’m not worried for the
boy. He was a sure tough, and I’d say he’s the sort
to be a deal safer off the earth. But it’s the trade.
It’s the stuff. He was reckoning to bring more along.
Say, Mac, does it look good to you? I’ve heard you
say you’d a hunch for these boys, setting out to clean
things up. Well? Is this cleaning up? Or is it the
thing I’ve been scared of right along&mdash;a hold-up?”</p>

<p>McLagan shook his head. His face was mask-like
in its seriousness. Claire, watching him, felt at that
moment she would have given much to read the thing
passing behind it.</p>

<p>“You can’t rightly tell, Victor,” he said. “But I
wouldn’t reckon that way without knowing more.
There was sure something queer about that boy. And
he was a tough, anyway.” Then he smiled, “It’s
queer, here I bring you word of such wealth coming
to Beacon as no gold can ever hand it. I’m showing
you how to get in and help yourself, yet you’re worried
for a bunch of dust that won’t be a circumstance
in Beacon when we open out.”</p>

<p>He turned to the girl, who was regarding him so
earnestly.</p>

<p>“You know, kid,” he said, “these men who handle
gold can’t see a thing but gold. They just love it to
death.”</p>

<p>He turned again to the banker.</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t worry with the Aurora bunch, Victor,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</a></span>
he said. “The oil boom coming is going to clean up
most things. Maybe they’ll go along with the rest.
You see, when the government realises the thing
Beacon can hand them there’ll be no room for white
shirts and hanging bees.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Outside the bank the girl made no further effort to
restrain the questions that were flooding her mind.</p>

<p>“Tell me, Ivor,” she cried, the moment they reached
the sidewalk again. “This man? This Cy Liskard?
Oh, I remember him. I’m never likely to forget him,
and the way you smashed him that night for his insult
to me. Who is he? Why did they hang him? I’ve
got to know things now. Is he&mdash;&mdash;?”</p>

<p>“The man who killed your brother Jim. The man
who murdered and robbed him. Julian Caspar, the
man who was trading Jim’s gold into that bank.”</p>

<p>Claire drew a deep breath. They had turned into
one of the almost undefined side roads, which was
little better than a track, in order to avoid the crowd
on the main street. They were making their way in
the direction of the girl’s home again. McLagan observed
her closely. Then a half smile lit his eyes.</p>

<p>“It’s time you knew things,” he said. Then he
asked gently, almost anxiously: “What does that just
mean, kid? Are you worried?”</p>

<p>Claire looked up. Her gaze was full of trust, full
of confidence, full of pride in the big creature who
had laboured so hard to capture her heart. She shook
her head.</p>

<p>“No, dear, I’m not worried&mdash;now,” she said. Then
a smile full of radiant love replaced the seriousness
in her eyes. “Like you, I’ve a hunch for those white-robed
folk. I sort of feel there’s no harm in them for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</a></span>
those running straight. There’s no ‘hold-up’ in them.
But I’m wondering. When your folk have got along,
and you go down country&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“We go down country,” the man corrected.</p>

<p>“When we go down country, how’ll they get on
without their&mdash;Chief Light?”</p>

<p>McLagan threw back his head in a great, unrestrained
laugh. He suddenly took possession of the
girl’s arm, and patted the hand that, for the moment,
rested in his.</p>

<p>“Guess they’ll need to elect a&mdash;new one,” he said.</p>

<p>“Jubilee?”</p>

<p>The girl’s eyes were shining with the delight it gave
her to show this great creature how deeply she had
penetrated his secret.</p>

<p>“Maybe,” he said. “I don’t know, and&mdash;Psha!
So long as I’ve got you, kid, I don’t care a darn.”</p>
